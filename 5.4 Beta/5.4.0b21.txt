5.4.0b21 Release Notes (Delta since b20)
Known Issues

    [788312] [SinglePassStereo] Deferred rendering + spot and point lights stereo discrepancy
    [780112] 2D: After changing state of 2DRectMask, Scene has to be reloaded for changes to take an effect
    [776827] Android: Shader fails in OpenGLES 3.0 on Adreno 306 when comparing fragment position with uniform.
    [723801] Animation: Editing .anim text file while Unity is running might crash the editor
    [800888] Editor: Editor crashes after overflowing both Width and Height fields of Game view resolution window
    [800900] Editor: Editor doesn't repaint when Services window is docked next to the Inspector
    [784831] Editor: When maximizing the Game window, the scale does not automatically adjust to the increased window size.
    [799288] GI: Baked transparency regressed in Enlighten 3.03 un2
    [688985] GI: Copying a scene loses the baked lighting. Workaround is to manually "Build Lighting."
    Graphics: In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights fallback to forward rendering.
    [790555] iOS: Crash with gpus_ReturnGuiltyForHardwareRestart when running GLES2/3 on A9 & A9X devices. Next iOS update is expected to fix this.
    [762371] Scene Management: SceneManager.UnloadScene hangs if called from a physics trigger. Workaround is to defer unload. This will not be addressed in 5.4.
    VR: In-development cinematic Image Effects (Bitbucket project) do not currently work with single-pass rendering. This will be addressed independently of the 5.4 release schedule.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects do not currently work reliably: CameraMotionBlur, ScreenSpaceAmbientObscurance. A fix is being developed.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects partially work: Blur, CreaseShading, DepthOfField, DepthOfFieldDeprecated, GlobalFog, NoiseAndGrain, ScreenSpaceAmbientOcclusion, Tonemapping. A fix is being developed.
    [777766] VR: Splash screen and single pass rendering have issues.
    [779207] VR: The default Text Mesh shader does not work in VR. Manually include a copy of the shader to workaround the problem.
    [776787] Windows Store: Unity APIs which take multi-dimensional arrays as parameters (e.g. TerrainData.SetHeights) do not work on UWP in configurations (e.g. Master config) in which .NET Native compilation is enabled. The bug has been logged with Microsoft.

Features

    VR: Oculus Support for DirectX 12.

Improvements

    Graphics: Added makeNoLongerReadable argument to Texture3D.Apply and Texture2DArray.Apply APIs, to be able to release system memory.
    Graphics: Added RenderTexture.GetNativeDepthBufferPtr for native code plugins.
    iOS/tvOS: Change to use relative symlinks for plugins when building to a related folder.
    Scripting: Added LightShadowsResolution property to scripting API to make it possible to adjust the shadow mapping quality in code at run time on a per-light basis.
    Shaders: Added ability to exclude shaders from automatic upgrade, by having "UNITY_SHADER_NO_UPGRADE" anywhere in shader source file.
    Shaders: Engine and built-in shaders use five fewer shader keywords now, leaving more keywords for users. The following keywords are thus removed: SOFTPARTICLES_OFF, HDR_LIGHT_PREPASS_OFF, HDR_LIGHT_PREPASS_ON, SHADOWS_OFF, DIRLIGHTMAP_OFF.
    VR: Updated to the 1.4 Oculus API.

Fixes

    [789557] Animation: A warning that was erroneously displayed in AnimationClip is now displayed in ModelImporter.
    [788452] Animation: Fixed a case where adding an IsActive property to a legacy animation would cause a crash when sampling.

    [789784] Animation: Fixed an issue where the transition preview wouldn't reappear when valid parameters were set (after it having disappeared when invalid parameters were set).
    [789586] Animation: Fixed case of animation clip being invalidated when adding an animation event.
    [796729] Animation: Fixed case of CullingMode not getting properties applied when changed during playmode in Inspector.
    [788132] Animation: Fixed case of GetHumanPose crashing when using it with a humanoid avatar with unsupported hierarchy.
    [778887] Animation: Fixed case of playable not updating when animator controller is already set in animator.
