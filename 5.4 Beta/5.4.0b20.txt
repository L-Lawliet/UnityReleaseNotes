5.4.0b20 Release Notes (Delta since b19)
Known Issues

    [788312] [SinglePassStereo] Deferred rendering + spot and point lights stereo discrepancy
    [780112] 2D: After changing state of 2DRectMask, Scene has to be reloaded for changes to take an effect
    [776827] Android: Shader fails in OpenGLES 3.0 on Adreno 306 when comparing fragment position with uniform.
    [800888] Editor: Editor crashes after overflowing both Width and Height fields of Game view resolution window
    [800900] Editor: Editor doesn't repaint when Services window is docked next to the Inspector
    [688985] GI: Copying a scene loses the baked lighting.
    Graphics: In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights fallback to forward rendering.
    [790555] iOS: Crash with gpus_ReturnGuiltyForHardwareRestart when running GLES2/3 on A9 & A9X devices. Next iOS update is expected to fix this.
    [761024] iOS: [Metal] Performance degradation in 5.4 with some custom shaders.
    [762371] Scene Management: SceneManager.UnloadScene hangs if called from a physics trigger. Workaround is to defer unload. This will not be addressed in 5.4.
    VR: In-development cinematic Image Effects (Bitbucket project) do not currently work with single-pass rendering. This will be addressed independently of the 5.4 release schedule.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects do not currently work reliably: CameraMotionBlur, ScreenSpaceAmbientObscurance. A fix is being developed.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects partially work: Blur, CreaseShading, DepthOfField, DepthOfFieldDeprecated, GlobalFog, NoiseAndGrain, ScreenSpaceAmbientOcclusion, Tonemapping. A fix is being developed.
    [777766] VR: Splash screen and single pass rendering have issues.
    [779207] VR: Text Mesh shaders and single pass rendering do not work. Manually including the shader will workaround the problem.
    [747545] Windows: [OpenGL] Unity crashes or hangs with no response on moving and undocking tabs.
    [776787] Windows Store: Unity APIs which take multi-dimensional arrays as parameters (e.g. TerrainData.SetHeights) do not work on UWP in configurations (e.g. Master config) in which .NET Native compilation is enabled. The bug has been logged with Microsoft.

Improvements

    Audio: Added ability to transition AudioMixer snapshots by scaled and unscaled time.
    Audio: Moved Preload Audio Data to the platform-specific settings section. The previous location was confusing as it was shown grayed-out in the inspector with a checkmark that depended on all overrides.
    Audio: SystemInfo now includes supportsAudio info.
    Particles: Added Undo support when auto re-parenting sub-emitters.

Fixes

    [792351] Android: Fixed an issue where Unity would emit "Unknown event structure (0)" to the log several times per second.
    [782248] Audio: AudioSource: Fixed issue whereby Doppler Level didn't work when used with custom spatializer plugins.
    [772946] Audio: Fixed case of component effect appearing disabled on play and getting enabled again after we pause and play.
    [763036] Audio: Fixed case of Unity crashing when the Disable Audio option was selected in project settings.
    [784887] Audio: Fixed crash when disabling Component which uses OnAudioFilterRead.
    Audio: Fixed handling of default DSP buffer size. Previously, once the buffer size was changed to something other than Default latency, changing it back to Default latency had no effect.
    [781566] Audio: Fixed issue where AudioListener with 2 custom scripts crashed when reinitializing the sound system.
    [775328] Audio: Fixed issue where the Audio Lowpass Frequency curve moved in the wrong direction in the AudioSource curve view.
    [771825] Audio: Fixed issue whereby adding an effect in the mixer with bypass effects enabled didn't rechain the component effect back properly.
    Audio: Fixed issue whereby the memory profiler did not report AudioClip memory correctly. The memory allocated by AudioClips was wrongly accumulated under AudioManager.
    [792497] Core: Fixed a crash when more that 65535 identically named objects were created.
    [771132] Editor: Fixed a crash when playing a scene with an iOS device connected as a Unity Remote.
    [588531] Editor: Fixed an issue where deleted folders are recreated if the meta file is still present in non-source control serialisation modes.
    [769033, 769504] Editor: Fixed crash when entering or exiting play mode when a GameObject with a missing script reference is present.
    [796682] Editor: Updated default license and activation host URL for staging and dev environments.
    [768232] Graphics: Fixed an issue where dynamic batching could produce corrupted geometry when vertex components are compressed.
    [778659] Graphics: Fixed incorrect normal/tangent generation when dynamic batching is used on a rotated object without a normal/tangent stream i.e. a rotated TextMesh object.
    [780867] Particles: Fixed sorting issue when using local space particles.
    [754270] Particles: Start delay is now only applied when the system time is 0.
    [766769] Runtime: Fix to reduce the overhead incurred by SetSiblingIndex calling OnTransformParentChanged.
    [790491] Substance: Fixed error when loading package file containing an old version of a substance file.
    [778027] WebGL: Fixed anisotropic filtering in Safari.
    [759492] WebGL: Fixed browser lock-up when profiling.
    [781565] WebGL: Fixed case of blendEquationSeparate shader errors being thrown.
    [790931, 789543] WebGL: Fixed Command key input issues on OS X.
    [792856] WebGL: Fixed error message about loading WebGL content from file:// URLs in browsers that don't support this.
    WebGL: Fixed float RenderTextures in WebGL 2.0 in Chrome.
    [794353] WebGL: Fixed floating point precision errors, which could result in a variety of errors during play.
    [782587] WebGL: Fixed point-light rendering on Windows when deferred rendering is enabled.
    [759286] WebGL: Fixed spot-light rendering on Windows when deferred rendering is enabled.
