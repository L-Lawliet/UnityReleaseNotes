Changes

    Android: Screen.dpi always returns densityDpi now

Improvements

    Editor: Added an editor warning whenever a shader with a lot of variants (e.g. Standard.shader) is added to the 'always loaded' list.
    Lighting: Improved an error message about invalid data when baking probes.
    Scripting: Added Light.customShadowResolution and QualitySetting.shadowResolution to scripting API to make it possible to adjust the shadow mapping quality in code at run time on a per-light basis.

    [763293] AssetBundles: Fixed AssetBundle.LoadFromFile usage with Application.streamingAssetsPath on Android
    [798640] Camera: Fixed issue with silently disabling cameras that have non-existing target display set on them.
