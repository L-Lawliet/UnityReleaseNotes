5.4.0b22 Release Notes (Delta since b21)
Release Date 20 June 2016

Known Issues

    [788312] There is some stereo discrepency on spotlights and point lights when using deffered rendering.
    [780112] 2D: After changing state of 2DRectMask, Scene has to be reloaded for changes to take an effect
    [776827] Android: Shader fails in OpenGLES 3.0 on Adreno 306 when comparing fragment position with uniform.
    [805547] Editor: Connect window shows in Inspector tab and then Editor crashes on closing.
    [800900] Editor: Editor doesn't repaint when Services window is docked next to the Inspector.
    [784831] Editor: When maximizing the Game window, the scale does not automatically adjust to the increased window size.
    [805864] Editor: [Editor][OSX][Regression] NullReferenceException in PackageImportTreeView after pressing Import button in Asset Store
    [688985] GI: Copying a Scene loses the baked lighting. Workaround is to manually use "Build Lighting."
    Graphics: In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights fallback to forward rendering.
    [762371] Scene Management: SceneManager.UnloadScene hangs if called from a physics trigger. Workaround is to defer unload. This will not be addressed in 5.4.
    VR: In-development cinematic Image Effects (Bitbucket project) do not currently work with single-pass rendering. This will be addressed independently of the 5.4 release schedule.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects do not currently work reliably: CameraMotionBlur, ScreenSpaceAmbientObscurance. A fix is being developed.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects partially work: Blur, CreaseShading, DepthOfField, DepthOfFieldDeprecated, GlobalFog, NoiseAndGrain, ScreenSpaceAmbientOcclusion, Tonemapping. A fix is being developed.
    [777766] VR: Splash screen and single pass rendering have issues.
    [779207] VR: The default Text Mesh shader does not work in VR. Manually include a copy of the shader to workaround the problem.
    [776787] Windows Store: Unity APIs which take multi-dimensional arrays as parameters (e.g. TerrainData.SetHeights) do not work on UWP in configurations (e.g. Master config) in which .NET Native compilation is enabled. The bug has been logged with Microsoft.

Changes

    Scripting: Using GameObject.AddComponent is no longer allowed and will throw an exception. Derive a class from MonoBehaviour and add it instead.

Improvements

    Graphics: Added a property to allow skipping the bounding box recalculation when setting the list of indices or triangles of a Mesh. This is useful for LODs that use a sliding window.
    Multiplayer: WebSocket: Improved memory allocation and socket writing procedure (fixed case of connection closing unexpectedly).
    Shaders: Added UNITY_SAMPLE_TEX3D_LOD macro, for consistency with other LOD sampling macros.
    VR: Added support for the Oculus Rift Remote: it presents itself to the input system as a joystick named "Oculus Remote".
