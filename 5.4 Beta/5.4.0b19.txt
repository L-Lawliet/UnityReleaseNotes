Unity 5.4.0b19 release notes
Known Issues

    [780112] 2D: After changing state of 2DRectMask scene has to be reloaded for changes to take an effect
    [776827] Android: Shader fails in OpenGLES 3.0 on Adreno 306 when comparing fragment position with uniform
    [791158] Android: [Audio] App with audio hangs on start if audio disabled in Project Audio settings
    Graphics: In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights will fallback to forward rendering.
    [790555] iOS: Crash with 'gpus_ReturnGuiltyForHardwareRestart' when running GLES2/3 on A9 & A9X devices. Next iOS update is expected to fix this.
    [761024] iOS: [Metal] Performance degradation in 5.4 with some custom shaders
    [762371] Scene Management: SceneManager.UnloadScene will hang if called from a physics trigger. Workaround is to defer unload. Will not be addressed in 5.4
    [771032] Terrain: Unity crashes when calling various methods on TerrainData with boundary values
    VR: In-Development Cinematic Image effects (bitbucket project) do not currently work with single pass rendering. Will not be addressed for 5.4
    [777766] VR: Splash Screen and single pass rendering has issues
    [778119] VR: Single Pass rendering: Standard Asset Image Effects do not currently work reliably, a fix is being worked on.
    [779207] VR: Text Mesh shaders and single pass rendering does not work. Manually including shader will workaround the problem.
    [747545] Windows: [OpenGL] Unity crashes or hangs with no respond on moving and undocking tabs.
    [776787] Windows Store: Unity APIs which use multidimensional arrays as parameters don't work on UWP when .NET Native compilation is enabled (for ex., Master config). For ex., TerrainData.SetHeights. This includes all Unity versions where UWP is supported. The bug has been logged with Microsoft.
