5.4.0b23 Release Notes (Delta since b22)
Release Date 28 June 2016
Known Issues

    [788312] There is some stereo discrepency on spotlights and point lights when using deffered rendering.
    [780112] 2D: After changing state of 2DRectMask, Scene has to be reloaded for changes to take an effect
    [805547] Editor: Connect window shows in Inspector tab and then Editor crashes on closing.
    [800900] Editor: Editor doesn't repaint when Services window is docked next to the Inspector.
    [805864] Editor: [Editor][OSX][Regression] NullReferenceException occurs in PackageImportTreeView after pressing Import button in Asset Store.
    [688985] GI: Copying a Scene loses the baked lighting. Workaround is to manually use "Build Lighting."
    Graphics: In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights fallback to forward rendering.
    [762371] Scene Management: SceneManager.UnloadScene hangs if called from a physics trigger. Workaround is to defer unload. This will not be addressed in 5.4.
    VR: In-development cinematic Image Effects (Bitbucket project) do not currently work with single-pass rendering. This will be addressed independently of the 5.4 release schedule.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects do not currently work reliably: CameraMotionBlur, ScreenSpaceAmbientObscurance. A fix is being developed.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects partially work: Blur, CreaseShading, DepthOfField, DepthOfFieldDeprecated, GlobalFog, NoiseAndGrain, ScreenSpaceAmbientOcclusion, Tonemapping. A fix is being developed.
    [779207] VR: The default Text Mesh shader does not work in VR. Manually include a copy of the shader to workaround the problem.
    [776787] Windows Store: Unity APIs which take multi-dimensional arrays as parameters (e.g. TerrainData.SetHeights) do not work on UWP in configurations (e.g. Master config) in which .NET Native compilation is enabled. The bug has been logged with Microsoft.

Features

    IL2CPP: Android support for IL2CPP is now official (previously 'experimental').

Improvements

    OpenGL: Optimized shader translation for matrix array accessing. This especially improves instancing performance.
    VR: The Oculus OVRPlugin signature check now happens only for non-development, release builds.

Fixes

    [781657] Android: Added an explicit clear for .mdb files for release builds.
    [787491] Android: Fixed a crash on PVR devices caused by a driver issue with KHR_debug.
    [777411] Editor: Fixed crash when registering Transform using Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo.
    [804750] Graphics: Fixed DepthNormals pass to no longer use very low precision (16bit) depth buffer. It now uses the same depth buffer format as regular rendering.
    [794054] Multiplayer: Fixed case of NetworkTransport.SetBroadcastCredentials crashing Unity.
    Multiplayer: Fixed issue whereby cleaning up a connection containing a StateUpdate channel could cause a crash.
    [776827] OpenGL: Applied workaround for ES3 shader compiler bugs on Adreno 3xx devices.
    [806089] Physics: Toggling 'Rigidbody2D.IsKinematic' in the Inspector during Play Mode now correctly changes the body type. Previously it had no effect.
    [803901] UI: Fixed issue with double rendering of world canvas in Editor.
    [793119] UI: Fixed off-by-1 error in InputField.characterLimit when ContentType != standard.
    [786986] UI: MaskUtilities fixes:
        Fix to skip inactive RectMask2D
        Fixed nested clipping.
    VR: Fixed file access error when building with Oculus or OpenVR plugins included in the Plugins folder.
    [802122] VR: Fixed VR scene rendering in Game View to use the correct aspect ratio and not render occlusion mask.
    VR: VR splash screen images now follow the gaze of the user so that they are always seen.
