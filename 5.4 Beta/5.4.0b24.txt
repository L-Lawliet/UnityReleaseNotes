    [785021] iOS: Fixed case of incorrect value being set in Xcode when the "Target minimum iOS version" player setting in Unity was set to 9.0.

    [657306] Scripting: Fixed thread safety of TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone and DateTime.Now.
    [790589] tvOS: Removed "Prepare iOS for recording" from tvOS player settings, which was breaking fullscreen movie playing.

Known Issues

    [788312] There is some stereo discrepency on spotlights and point lights when using deferred rendering.
    [775353] Asset Management: Crash in HandleSetTransformFatherDragAndDrop when dragging a Tree Prefab to the Hierarchy window.
    [800900] Editor: Editor doesn't repaint when Services window is docked next to the Inspector.
    [808123] Editor: In some cases, Editor freezes when Scene is opened after switching platform to Android.
    [804333] Editor: Reverting prefab and pressing undo can result in a crash.
    [688985] GI: Copying a Scene loses the baked lighting. Workaround is to manually use "Build Lighting."
    [808616] Graphics: GL.LoadPixelMatrix is broken (VR matrix changes in 5.4, regression). Will be fixed in the next build.
    Graphics: In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights fallback to forward rendering.
    [805227] Particles: Particles render as trails in some cases.
    [809364] UI: 9-Sliced images whose sprite has mipmapping can blur if size is too small. Disable mipmapping as workaround
    [779516] UI: Editing Text with Best Fit enabled causes artifacts to appear.
    [795877] UI: World space canvas flickers when resizing game view.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects do not currently work reliably: CameraMotionBlur, ScreenSpaceAmbientObscurance. A fix is being developed.
    [778119] VR: Single-pass rendering: The following Standard Asset Image Effects partially work: Blur, CreaseShading, DepthOfField, DepthOfFieldDeprecated, GlobalFog, NoiseAndGrain, ScreenSpaceAmbientOcclusion, Tonemapping. A fix is being developed.
    [779207] VR: The default Text Mesh shader does not work in VR. Manually include a copy of the shader to workaround the problem.

To be addressed post-5.4:

    [780112] 2D: After changing state of 2DRectMask, Scene has to be reloaded for changes to take an effect
    [808080] Asset Management: Editor crashes when replacing Prefab with Alt key pressed.
    [762371] Scene Management: SceneManager.UnloadScene hangs if called from a physics trigger. Workaround is to defer unload. This will not be addressed in 5.4.
    VR: In-development cinematic Image Effects (Bitbucket project) do not currently work with single-pass rendering. This will be addressed independently of the 5.4 release schedule.
    [776787] Windows Store: Unity APIs which take multi-dimensional arrays as parameters (e.g. TerrainData.SetHeights) do not work on UWP in configurations (e.g. Master config) in which .NET Native compilation is enabled. The bug has been logged with Microsoft.
