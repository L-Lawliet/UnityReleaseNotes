Unity 2.0.1 was a quick update we released to be able to support Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard".

    Fixed editor crash on Mac OS X Leopard whenever color property was in the Inspector.

    Fixed 'F' key focusing not working on Leopard.

    Fixed Layer popup in GameObject inspector on Leopard.

    Fix double click not launching asset editor on Leopard.

    Disabled mipmapped render textures on GeForce 8600 on Leopard and Tiger (an OpenGL driver bug which leaks memory is not fixed yet).

    Fixed some broken links in the documentation.
