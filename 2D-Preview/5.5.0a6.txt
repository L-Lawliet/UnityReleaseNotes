Unity 2D Experimental Preview Release 2
Release Date 23 August 2016

What’s New!

    New: CompositeCollider2D component
        Merges other 2D colliders together if set to do so, forming a composite shape based on these colliders.

    New: TileMapCollider2D component
        Generates 2D collider shapes for a Tile Map.
        Note: Previous functionality for PolygonCollider2D for Tile Map has been removed. Please use this to generate 2D colliders for the Tile Map.

    New: Sprite Atlas
        A new asset that takes folder(s), texture(s) and individual sprite(s) as input, then pack all sprites in them into an atlas texture with the unified settings.
        The new packing is parallelised, the time used to pack the similar amount of sprites compared to current Sprite Packer should be shorter.
        Sprite packing with Packing Tag in texture is still available. Any texture with a packing tag will not be packed into the new Sprite Atlas even if they are included. Remove the packing tag to use the new system.
        Use this script to convert all your existing packing tag to Sprite Atlas asset and have it automatically populated with folder/texture. Please backup your project before you run it for real.

    New: Axis Distance Sort
        Under Edit/Project Settings/Graphics
            Set the Transparency Sort Mode
                Default - Sorts based on the Camera mode.
                Perspective - Sorts based on perspective view.
                Orthographics - Sorts based on orthographic view.
                Custom Axis - Sorts based on the given axis set in Transparency Sort Axis.
        Set the Transparency Sort Axis
            If the Transparency Sort Mode is set to Custom Axis, renderers in the scene view will be sorted based on the distance of this axis from the camera.


Improvements

    Improvement: Sorting Group
        Sorting Group no longer break batches for other renderers

    Improvement: SpriteRenderer 9-slice Collider2D support
        BoxCollider2D and PolygonCollider2D collision shape will readjust following 9-slice properties from SpriteRenderer when in Sliced/Tiled mode.
        Supported Collider2Ds have a ‘Auto Tiling’ toggle to enable/disable collision shape automatic update.

    Improvement: Tile Map
        Snapping of GameObjects to Grid
        Hotkeys for Palette
            B - Paint
            U - Box Fill
            I - Pick
            D - Erase
            G - Flood Fill
        Multilayer painting for Tile Map
        Toggle for selecting Tile Asset from palette


Breaking Changes

    Tile Map
        Tile Map APIs have been changed, please do update your existing scripts.
        Tile Map APIs have been moved to its own namespace UnityEngine.TileMap.
        VirtualTiles have been renamed to EditorPreviewTiles.
        BaseTile has been renamed to TileBase.
        TileFlags have been renamed.
            OverrideColor -> LockColor
            OverrideTransform -> LockTransform
            OverrideSpawnGameObjectRuntimeOnly -> InstantiateGameObjectRuntimeOnly
            OverrideAll -> LockAll
        TileData
            TileData.gameobject -> TileData.gameObject
        TileAnimationData
            TileAnimationData.animationTimeOffset -> TileAnimationData.animationStartTime
        PolygonCollider2D no longer generates a collider shape for the TileMap. Please use the new TileMapCollider2D instead.

    9-Slice
        The internal data type that represents 9-slice properties in SpriteRenderer has changed. You will have to reapply your 9-slice properties again after upgrading to Preview 2.

Bugfixes

    Tile Map
        Fixed crash when camera is set to perspective view and pulled back so that a large area is in view.
        Fixed bug where paint mode is lost if editor is changed to full screen mode
        Fixed bug where paint mode cannot be selected unless a Tile Map is selected if Palette is not docked.
        Fixed error when dragging prefabs, materials or scripts over the Tile Map Palette
        Fixed bug where Tile Map and instances of Tile Map prefabs does not update across playmode.

    Sorting Group
        Transform gizmo is no longer stuck at (0, 0, 0) regardless of the position of the sorting group.
