5.5.0x3-2D-Build
Released 30 Nov 2016

Unity 2D Experimental Preview Release 3
New and Improved

    Improvement: Grid
        You can now set the color of the rendered Grid in the Editor

    Improvement: Physics 2D
        Contact Filter 2D
            Contact Filter 2D is now used in “IsTouching” calls [​IMG]
            Contact Filter 2D is also now used in most physics queries: Physics2D.GetContacts, Collider2D.GetContacts, Rigidbody2D.GetContacts, Linecast, Raycast, CircleCast, BoxCast, CapsuleCast, Collider2D.Cast, Rigidbody2D.Cast, OverlapPoint, OverlapCircle, OverlapBox, OverlapArea & OverlapCapsule.

    Improvement: Sorting Group
        Sorting Group Editor
            List to view renderers/sorting groups under selected sorting group
            Sorting Group is no longer a renderer

    Improvement: Tilemap
        New Palette System
            Palettes are prefabs of GameObjects with a Grid/Tilemap structure
            Palettes work exactly as they do in Scene View. Custom tiles on a palette can retrieve data from other components on the Palette prefab
            Add new palettes with plus button in palette window dropdown or by dragging existing prefabs on top of the window.
            Share palettes by handing out the Tilemap prefabs
            Isometric/Hexagonal layouts are rendered correctly in the Palette
            List of Palette prefabs you have selected to use are stored in Library/TilemapEditorSettings.asset
        New Brush Selection System
            Grid Brushes can be used when a Grid Brush script exists in Assets
            Grid Brush assets can still be used for customised brush behaviour
        New Focus mode
            Set focus on selected Tilemap layer or Tilemap as a whole when editing
        New Inspector for plain old Tile
        New Render mode for Tilemap Renderer to determine how Tilemap sprites are rendered
            Chunk - Tilemap sprites are grouped by location and rendered as a whole
            Individual - Each Tilemap sprite is rendered individually and can interleave with other renderers
        New functions
            ResizeBounds
            Removes all tiles outside of the defined origin and size of the Tilemap
            CompressBounds
            Changes origin and size of the Tilemap to ensure all tiles lie within the bounds defined by the origin and size

    Improvement: Sprite Atlas
        Late binding atlas
            Sprite Atlas can set to not bind as default to the packed Sprites.
                Sprite will appear as empty mesh with no texture in the scene.
            User can bind a Sprite Atlas via a callback or direct API.
        Down-scaled Variant
            Sprite Atlas can become a variant of another Sprite Atlas by dragging the latter to the “Master Atlas” field in inspector.
            Variant will down-scale master’s texture with the given multiplier.
        Inspector
            New look and new functionality.

    Breaking Changes

    Tilemap
        TileMap has been renamed to Tilemap
        Tilemap namespace has changed from UnityEngine.Tilemap to UnityEngine.Tilemaps
        GridBrushBase
            Pick function has been added for Picking behaviour
            Set functions have been removed, use Pick function instead

    Sprite Atlas
        Due to internal changes, old SpriteAtlas assets might be corrupt or broken. Please create a new one to replace it.
        SpriteAtlas APIs have moved inside UnityEngine.U2D and UnityEditor.U2D namespaces.
        GetSprites() will no longer return a new array of Sprites. It now accept a pre-allocated array and fill it up instead.

    Bugfixes
        Tilemap
            Fixed bug in generation of collision shape for Tilemap Collider 2D when cell size is large than 1.
            Fixed bug in generation of collision shape for Tilemap Collider 2D where overlaps in sprites creates holes
            Fixed crash for Tilemap Collider 2D when tile does not have a valid sprite
            Fixed bug in Transform tool movement when Palette window has a tool selected causing scene view to be unresponsive
            Add gizmo when Tilemap Collider 2D is selected and not using a Composite Collider 2D
            Fixed rendering issue for Tilemap Renderer with a hexagonal grid where tiles are not rendered at chunk borders
            Contact Filter 2D collision normal angle now correctly operates using a 0-360 degree range rather than -180/+180 and compares collision normal angles correctly.
            PolygonCollider2D/BoxCollider2D shape with large vertex but a small area passes validation. Case 820300.
            Shape casting against a multi-edge Edge Collider 2D now works correctly in cases of all shapes at any angle or position. (Case 833737).
            Continuously setting the body-type to the same type should not cause contact recalculations and potential instabilities (Case 835334).
            Fixed issue when removing Composite Collider 2D doesn’t disconnect attached Collider 2D correctly resulting in them not being recreated correctly (case 826902).
            Setting enabled state of a Collider2D attached to a Composite Collider 2D no longer produces ‘shape’ assert warnings.
        Vector2i/3i
            Fix serialization for Vector2i/3i
