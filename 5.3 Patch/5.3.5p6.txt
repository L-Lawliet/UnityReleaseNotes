Release Notes 5.3.5p6
Release Date 29 June 2016

Improvements

    Audio: Added ability to transition AudioMixer snapshots by scaled and unscaled time.
    Audio: Added virtualization of audio effects. For audio sources that are virtual because they have been culled due to low audibility or priority, attached effect components or spatializers are now also bypassed in order to save CPU use. The new behaviour is on by default, but can be turned off in the audio project settings.
    Audio: Audio clip waveform preview now displays the actual format used for compression when the default format isnâ€™t available on a certain platform.
    Audio: Audio clips with the "Streaming" load type are no longer preloaded. This is done to reduce the number of open file handles in scenes referencing a large number of streamed clips. The behaviour is not affected except for a slight increase in playback delay of this type of audio clips.
    Audio: Fixed audio clip waveform preview rendering sync issues after import, and improved the way the waveforms are being rendered to be more dynamic and reveal more detail.
    Audio: Moved Preload Audio Data to the platform-specific settings section. The previous location was confusing as it was shown grayed-out in the inspector with a checkmark that depended on all overrides.
    Audio: SystemInfo now includes supportsAudio info.
    iOS: Update Build and Run to work with Xcode 8
    VR: Updated to Oculus Version 1.5.
