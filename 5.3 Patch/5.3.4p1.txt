5.3.4p1 Release Notes

Improvements

    Android: IL2CPP - Stripping of symbols and debug info is now enabled by default. Development builds still have symbols which makes for a slightly larger binary.
    Asset management: Added offset argument to AssetBundle.CreateFromFile and AssetBundle.LoadFromFile methods.
    Hardware Stats updates information that might change during sessions.
    iOS: Added a compile flag in the trampoline code in order to allow the user to disable the filtering of emoji characters.
