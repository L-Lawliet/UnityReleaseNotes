Features

Note that these are not yet easily selectable - this will come soon via an update to the Launcher.
    GI: Progressive Lightmapper is now out of preview!
    Package Manager: Added Package Manager user interface v1.3.0, from where a project's packages can be managed and new packages can be discovered. Note that the UI isn't yet final and will see further improvements during the beta cycle. Known limitations at this time:
        No visual indication of recommended vs. otherwise discoverable packages.
        Light on details for most packages, including for alternative versions available.

Improvements

    Multiplayer: Two or more channels can now share the messages order, so that messages which send via differnet channels will be delivered in order.
