Release notes
2018.1.0b10 Release Notes (diff since 2018.1.0b9)

System Requirements Changes

    Removed support for Windows XP in standalone player builds. Windows Vista is the now minimum supported OS for Windows standalone player.
    Deprecated support for MonoDevelop. VisualStudio is now the recommended and supported C# editor on both macOS and Windows.

Known Issues in 2018.1.0b10

    Camera: MAC OSX - Raycasting is incorrect (related to Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay).
    GI: "SerializedObject target has been destroyed" appears after environment lighting change.
    GI: Editor crashes after assigning Light Probe Group to Anchor Override Parameter.
    GI: In built Player the IsLightmapBakeTypeSupported() GCAllocs 17B every frame when CPU usage is 0.0%.
    GI: [PLM] Supersampling doesn't work.
    GI: Progressive Lightmapper doesn't work on Linux, which means that all 3D templates will crash on launch. The 2D template is not affected however.
    Graphics: Editor crashes at ImageFilters::BlitMultiTap when stepping into Graphics.BlitMultiTap() method.
    Particles: Line renderer is rendered in scene/game window when selecting object in the Project window.
    Scripting: Editor crashes when calling NativeArray<T>.Equals().
    SpeedTree: SpeedTree meshes have bad texcoord data after updating to 2018.1

Known Issues - won't be fixed in 2018.1
    OSX: [OSX 10.13][2018.1] Rapidly switching between 2 game view tabs multiple times may freeze or crash the editor when rendering with Metal. Note: it's much harder to reproduce on the latest 10.13.4 Beta (17E160e).

Features
    Package Manager: Updated Package Manager user interface (from where a project's packages can be managed and new packages can be discovered) to v1.8.1. What's new in 1.8.1:

        The built-in packages tab is now hidden, as it is not yet fully functional.
        Fixed sorting of the package list in the "All" tab.
        Fix to prevent loop error report with an invalid manifest.
        Fix to prevent infinite error reporting when an exception is thrown during an operation.
        Fix to only show "View Changes" when there is an "Update" button to display.
        Fixed typos in the dialog displayed when updating the Package Manager UI itself.
        Added "View Documentation" link to the package details area.
        Added "View changes" link to the package details area.
