Unity 5.6.0b2
Released: December 20, 2016

5.6.0b2 Release Notes (Delta since b1)
Known Issues

    Animation: Crash when previewing clip in AW. (851483)
    Animation: Selecting a curve preset in the Importer generates error (854799)
    Asset Pipeline: Referencing UnityEditor.iOS.Extensions.Xcode throws exception after reimporting assets. (778581)
    Editor: Handles in the scene view are incorrectly offset by 2 points (856685)
    GI: On new projects, graphic settings are not initialized correctly, so realtime GI and shadows are missing. Workaround is to save and re-start Unity. (858159)
    iOS: Rendering orientation is incorrect if orientation is overridden in Start() in your projectâ€™s first scene.
    Particles: Crash when a particle system is sub-emitter of more than one other particle system. (857065)
    VR: [Daydream] Deadlock issue when quitting an app, where the app may still execute for up to 3s after it goes away. (861469)
    VR: [Daydream] iOS is not supported with the current native integration but will be available in an upcoming beta release.
    VR: [Daydream] The unity define that is used to mark Daydream support is incorrectly defined as UNITY_DAYDREAM instead of UNITY_HAS_GOOGLEVR. (861741)
    VR: [Daydream] There is a tiling bug in the Pixel Snapdragon GPU driver that appears when post-processing effects are used. Unlike 5.4, 5.6 currently runs post processing image effects all the time, so the tiling issue will be more noticeable. This will be fixed in a future driver update that Google will ship as an OTA update for affected devices.
    VR: [Daydream] There is no native controller integration yet. For controller use please use the Unity SDK provided by Google.
    VR: [Daydream] You may notice that your Daydream VR display may be dimmer than other VR devices. This is by design as a means of prolonging battery life while in VR.

Features

    Editor: (As also mentioned under API Changes) Exposed the following custom handle classes in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls: BoxBoundsHandle, CapsuleBoundsHandle, SphereBoundsHandle.

    Editor: Interactive handles for editing primitive collider types in the scene view now all use the same logic:
        Dragging a handle expands the size only on that side.
        Holding pins the center in place.
        Holding scales the shape uniformly.

    These changes apply to BoxCollider, CapsuleCollider, SphereCollider, BoxCollider2D, CapsuleCollider2D, and CircleCollider2D
    Editor: TreeView IMGUI Control, which can display hierarchical data that can be expanded and collapsed. Additionally it lets you create list views and multi-column tables for Editor tools.

    GI: Added Light modes, which replace mixed mode lighting and provide flexible ways to merge baked and realtime shadows. As part of this:
        Added ability to bake shadowmasks.
        New Lighting window layout.
        Added Light Explorer window.

    Please see the 5.6 upgrade guide for details.

Improvements

    GI: Enlighten SDK upgraded to version 3.07p1. This should provide precompute time reductions, which will be especially noticeable in the CalculateSystemDependencies step as well as other steps which perform ray-tracing. Additional details:
        An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather which would result in wrong lighting when using transparent materials.
        An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather which would result in it ignoring the 'backface behaviour type' material property.
        Fixed issue that prevented baked light masks working in conjunction with transparency textures.
        Fixed a bug resulting in wrong lighting for SSD objects when using probes with non-default axes or SH coefficient orders.
        When baking direct probe lighting, the per-light option to disable direct lighting is no longer ignored.
    Graphics: Added cube array texture support to OSX Metal.
    Particles: Full support for multiple selection and editing of Particle Systems.
    VR: Added single-pass stereo support for Gear VR (using GL_OVR_multiview).

API Changes

    Animation: Added AnimatorOverrideController.GetOverrides and AnimatorOverrideController.ApplyOverrides. (752095)
    Animation: Added to AvatarMask: AddTransformPath, RemoveTransformPath.
    Animation: Deprecated AnimatorOverrideController.clips. (752095)
    Animation: Moved AvatarMask from UnityEditor.Animations to UnityEngine.
    Editor: (As also mentioned under Features) Exposed the following custom handle classes in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls: BoxBoundsHandle, CapsuleBoundsHandle, SphereBoundsHandle.

Fixes

    Animation: Fixed an issue where animator with animate physics would teleport objects. (847015)
    Animation: Fixed AnimatorControllerPlayable memory leak.
    Animation: Fixed bug in BlendTree thresholds recomputation. (777936)
    Animation: Fixed problem where animation events were not being fired properly by Playables. (847874)
    Animation: Removed parameter filter when user adds a new animator controller parameter. (847134)
    iOS: Build flags are now prefixed with $(inherited) in Xcode project to improve compatibility with CocoaPods.
    Playables: Fixed a crash where UnloadUnusedAssets would unload Animation Clips used by AnimationClipPlayables. (854615)
