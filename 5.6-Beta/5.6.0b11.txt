Known Issues

    Animation: Problems with Animator in 5.6.0 beta after upgrading project from 5.5.0p3 (864062)
    Editor: Setting Custom Editor window's position to what it already is, changes it's position (593259)
    GI: Progressive Lightmapper crashes on certain Scenes during the bake when instances are moved (depending on timing). Fix coming soon.
    GI: [PVR] 32bit Unity 5.6 crashes if scene is baked with lightprobes and PVR (888806)

    Particles: Sorting Fudge is not working (884637)
    Physics: RigidBody.collisionDetectionMode cannot be set during runtime if it is initially set to one of the continuous options. (784529)
    UI: Adding UI elements via script will cause OnDisable and OnEnable to be called on all scripts in the hierarchy if a RectTransform needs to be added. Workaround is to add a RectTransform component in the new GameObject call . For example new GameObject("Canvas", typeof(RectTransform)); (882791)
    Video: [Android] Video fails to play (and may crash) on some device/OS version combinations. (862078)
    VR: [Daydream] There is a memory leak when you exit and re-enter VR mode. This leak is on the native Google VR code and Google is actively working on fixing this. (859281)
    VR: [Daydream] You may notice that your Daydream VR display is dimmer than other VR devices. This is by design, as a means of prolonging battery life while in VR.
    VR: UNITY_HAS_GOOGLEVR is enabled for iOS, but the Google SDK for Unity might not check for it correctly and try to use compatibility mode for iOS. This will be fixed with an SDK update from Google.
    VR: VRSettings.renderViewportScale has unintended graphical effects when rendering sections of the screen at values less than 1. (851282)
    Windows: Windows Store: PlayerPrefs gets corrupted on Windows 8.1-10 on sudden reset. (855595)

To be fixed post 5.6.0

    Android: When MuteOtherAudioSources option is disabled and there's no READ_PHONE_STATE permission, the Unity application running on Android 5.1 or older devices might not mute itself during an incoming phone call. This might cause rejections when submitting to Samsung app store.
    Services: Collab cannot update to the latest revision if the current revision has been archived and there is a conflict. (857465)
    VR: [Daydream] There is no native controller integration yet. For controller use, please use the Unity SDK provided by Google.
