Features

    Player: Native Daydream integration as a VR target for Unity VR applications.

Changes

    Scripting: The behaviour for ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize has changed when using Instantiate and UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.CreatePrefab. Previously the callback was invoked twice: once before the object was fully deserialized (internal references not yet updated) and once after the object was fully deserialized (internal references are updated). In Unity 5.6 and above, SerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize is only invoked once, after the object is fully deserialized, when using Instantiate and UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.CreatePrefab.

Improvements

    IL2CPP: Generated C++ code will now contain annotations of original C# source code, as long as PDB/MDB files acompanying the C# source code are present on the machine at conversion time.
    Particles: The UI for Custom Vertex Streams has been redesigned to allow greater flexibility over what data to send to the shader, and to add more control over how it is packed into the TEXCOORD channels.

API Changes

    Graphics: Added SystemInfo.maxCubemapSize API, analogous to SystemInfo.maxTextureSize. (852309)
    Physics: Exposed Physics.ClosestPoint. Computes the point on the surface of a given Collider that is closest to a specified location.
    Physics: Exposed Physics.ComputePenetration. Computes the minimal translation required to separate the two given Colliders. Doesn't require the Colliders to be placed at the given pose prior to the test, so is useful for writing custom character controllers.

Fixes

    Editor: Fixed keyboard input when there are multiple GameViews open. (767109)
    Editor: Holding CTRL/ALT no longer stretches the Game View when zooming it with the scroll wheel. (851617)
    WebGL: Fixed capturing of mouse moved events from web page. (831631)
    WebGL: Fixed issues relating to reading into floating point textures.

The following are changes and fixes to 5.6.0 features and regressions...
Fixes

    Editor: Fixed case of graphics settings using incorrect default editor. (852403)
    Editor: Fixed issue where the local cache server did not work if there were spaces in the path to the Unity Editor executable.

    IL2CPP: Fixed case of raycaster sometimes being stripped when using IL2CPP. (848670)
    IL2CPP: Fixed source of a crash that could occur in the player, when a virtual method was called on a value type and that value type implemented an interface which had an overload of that virtual method. (849701)
    IL2CPP: Implemented the array SetValue method for arrays of nullable types. (849072)

5.6.0b1 Release Notes (Full)
Features

    2D: Sorting Group:
        Sorts a group of renderers (for instance, a character made up of a bunch of sprite renderers) as a whole without any interleaving of other renderers.
    2D: Sprite Editor Window now supports Sprite outline editing to control Sprite mesh generation.
    Animation: Added tracking of Animator State Machine view positions
    Compute:
    Facebook: Added "Facebook" as a new Build target. This lets you publish you builds to Facebook using either WebGL or the Facebook Gameroom Windows app.
    Graphics: Added physically based rendering material validator. Albedo and Specular values can be validated against acceptable ranges. Albedo values can also be validated against user defined luminance ranges.
    Graphics: Added support for Metal Compute (iOS/macOS).
    Graphics: HDR MSAA anti-aliasing support. Using HDR rendering and MSAA anti-aliasing with forward shading now works as expected!
    Graphics: Support for DrawMeshInstancedIndirect, where draw arguments are supplied from a ComputeBuffer.
    Graphics: Support for Procedural Instancing, where instance data is supplied via a custom source in the shader, rather than from Constant Buffers.
    Graphics: Vulkan rendering backend added for Android, Linux and Windows. It is not used by default just yet; drag to the top of graphics API list in Player Settings to use it.
    Physics: Added new CompositeCollider2D component providing the ability to merge together BoxCollider2D & PolygonCollider2D colliders.
    Physics: Physics Debug Visualization.
        Designed to provide a "ground truth" for what is going on in our physics middleware and to quickly find the corresponding Colliders in the Unity scene.
        Also serves as a profiling tool as it can hide all sleeping Rigidbodies as well as show all concave MeshColliders.
    Player: Native Daydream integration as a VR target for Unity VR applications.
    Video: VideoPlayer compoonent and VideoClipImporter asset importer. They replace MovieTexture and its importer (available with a legacy control). The workflow audio platform support and scripting API will get improvements in the next aplhas

Changes

    Android: Buildpipe - Removed AnyCPU option from .so files in Plugin inspector.
    Editor: Building in linear color space is no longer allowed for platforms that don't support it.
    Graphics: Refactored camera render ordering code. When a scene is rendered it now figures out which cameras can share the same render target. The rules for this are:
        Same display.
        Are we in VR (implicit shared target).
        They share the same viewport.
        They all have or do not have a depth buffer. These cameras are then split into a 'stack' that is rendered based on depth ordering into a shared texture. The texture will have the most 'common' settings from the cameras in the stack:
        If any camera wants MSAA it will be an MSAA buffer.
        If any camera wants HDR it will be a HDR buffer.
        If there are any deferred cameras in the stack MSAA will be disabled (MSAA is not compatable).
    Graphics: Removed MSAA from back buffer on MOST devices / platforms. Much like HDR, MSAA generally now requires a render texture. This is implicitly supported via the render stack mechanism. If you require MSAA the target that will be rendered to will have MSAA enabled (so long as deferred is not used in the stack). On iOS and Android we still allow MSAA BB as these platforms have a large number of no image effects games and we want to avoid the extra blit.
    Linux / SteamOS: Switched window management and input handling from X11 to SDL2 on Linux / SteamOS.
    Scripting: Script serialization errors that were introduced in Unity 5.4 but did not always throw a managed exception, now always do so in Unity 5.6.

    Scripting: The behaviour for ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize has changed when using Instantiate and UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.CreatePrefab. Previously the callback was invoked twice: once before the object was fully deserialized (internal references not yet updated) and once after the object was fully deserialized (internal references are updated). In Unity 5.6 and above, SerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize is only invoked once, after the object is fully deserialized, when using Instantiate and UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.CreatePrefab.

    Shaders: Shader compilation now stops on the first error.
    Windows Store: D3D is now the default build type when building for Universal 10 SDK.

Improvements

    2D: Axis Distance Sort:
        Added CustomAxis to TransparencySortMode of Camera to allow users to sort renderers against a preferred axis instead of just by depth from the camera.
    2D: Refactored the internal storage of Sprite data to a more flexible storage structure. This is the precursor to new 2D features coming down the pipelne. Note that textures will therefore be re-imported on opening an existing project in Unity 5.6 for the first time.
    Android: Added support for managed stack traces on Android with IL2CPP.
    Animation: Added a 3rd spine bone, UpperChest, to humanoid rig.
    Animation: Added tracking of Animator State Machine view positions
    Animation: Disabled auto-framing of AnimatorController when selecting states or transitions
    Animation: Performance improvements for selection and keyframe manipulation in Curve Editor.
    Compute: Added ability to setup & dispatch compute shaders from CommandBuffers. See new CommandBuffer functions: SetCompute*Param, DispatchCompute, CopyCounterValue.
    Compute: ComputeShader inspector lists kernels, and compiled code shows disassembly on DX11. UNITY_VERSION macro is passed while compiling compute shaders, just like for regular shaders.
    DX12: Reduced system and video memory usage.
    Editor: Added interface support to Selection.GetFiltered.
    Editor: Editor's game view window will fully support touches on Windows when touch screen is available (for ex., Surface Pro). Functions like Input.GetTouch should therefore start working.
    Editor: Graphics device arguments now persist when relaunching editor.
    Editor: Window layouts are now serialized as text.
    GI: Added rgb9e5 float texture format for precomputed realtime GI on all supported platforms. This format can be interpolated without artifacts. Unsupported platforms will fall back to RGBM encoding and can still have banding from interpolation.
    GI: Added to ReflectionProbe: defaultTexture, defaultTextureHDRDecodeValues, textureHDRDecodeValues.
    GI: Enlighten SDK upgraded to version 3.07. This should provide precompute time reductions, which will be especially noticeable in the CalculateSystemDependencies step as well as other steps which perform ray-tracing.
    GI: Updated default shadow near plane offset.
    GI: usesRevertedZBuffer is now exposed to SystemInfo.
    Graphics: Added CommandBuffer functions: SetViewport, SetViewMatrix, SetProjectionMatrix, SetViewProjectionMatrices.
    Graphics: Added RenderQueue.GeometryLast enum value.
    Graphics: Added SystemInfo.graphicsUVStartsAtTop property.
    Graphics: CommandBuffer API improvements:
        More CommandBuffer APIs: CopyTexture, EnableShaderKeyword, DisableShaderKeyword.
        CommandBuffer.GetTemporaryRT got an enableRandomWrite argument.
    Graphics: HDR rendering supports R11G11B10 float formats in addition to FP16. This can be configured in Graphics Settings per platform & tier.
    IL2CPP: Generated C++ code will now contain annotations of original C# source code, as long as PDB/MDB files acompanying the C# source code are present on the machine at conversion time.
    Particles: Custom Data can now be configured via the Inspector using a new Module, instead of exclusively via Script.
    Particles: Gradient Editor now supports HDR colors when used in the Custom Data streams.
    Particles: Huge performance improvement for particle collision against 2D Colliders.
    Particles: Improved overlap solver for particle collision against 2D Colliders.
    Particles: The UI for Custom Vertex Streams has been redesigned to allow greater flexibility over what data to send to the shader, and to add more control over how it is packed into the TEXCOORD channels.
    Physics: 2D contacts are now shown in the Inspector 'Info' rollout for Collider2D and Rigidbody2D.
    Physics: Added a non-allocating way to retrieve contacts per Collider2D or Rigidbody2D using Physics2D.GetContacts (), Collider2D.GetContacts () & Rigidbody2D.GetContacts ().
    Physics: Complete rewrite of internal 2D contact processing providing a more robust and reliable reporting of contacts.
    Physics: New ContactFilter2D, allowing physics queries to filter by layer mask, Z depth, normal angle and trigger inclusion.
    Physics: Provision of non-allocating overloads that use the new ContactFilter2D for Linecast, Raycast, BoxCast, CircleCast, CapsuleCast, OverlapPoint, OverlapCircle, OverlapBox, OverlapArea, OverlapCapsule, GetContacts & IsTouching.
    Profiling: Added Profiling.Recorder API for retrieving timings from builtin Profiler labels.
    Shaders: HLSLPROGRAM shader snippet support. Same as CGPROGRAM, with one difference: HLSLSupport.cginc and UnityShaderVariables.cginc includes are not added automatically.
    Shaders: Preprocessor macros SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX, SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT, SHADER_STAGE_DOMAIN, SHADER_STAGE_HULL, SHADER_STAGE_GEOMETRY, SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE are defined when compiling each shader stage.
    Shaders: The .hlsl file extension is now recognized in the same way as .cginc one (included into generated IDE projects, opened same way from the editor).
    Terrain: Terrain Inspector now remembers the last selected brush shape.
    Terrain: Terrain LOD pre-computation is optimized and now runs faster (specifically, TerrainData.SetHeights and setting the size property are faster now).
    VR: Attached VR/AR devices will now add their remote resolution to the Game View sizes dropdown in the Editor.
    Web: In UnityWebRequest, response code and headers are now available to scripts as soon as they are downloaded. Previously they were accesible only after the whole download was complete.
    Windows Store: Significantly reduced the size of Windows Store support installers.

API Changes

    Asset Pipeline: Added new API methods AssetDatabase.GetImplicitAssetBundleName and AssetDatabase.GetImplicitAssetBundleVariantName, which dynamically compute the name of the AssetBundle and AssetBundle Variant that a given asset belongs to.(834008)
    Graphics: Added array property getters (e.g. GetFloatArray) for Material, MaterialPropertyBlock and Shader classes.
    Graphics: Added Graphics.ConvertTexture function, for copying between textures of different sizes/formats.
    Graphics: Added List overloads for array property setters for Material, MaterialPropertyBlock, Shader and CommandBuffer classes.

    Physics: Added minMoveDistance property to CharacterController script API.
    Physics: Exposed Physics.ClosestPoint. Computes the point on the surface of a given Collider that is closest to a specified location.
    Physics: Exposed Physics.ComputePenetration. Computes the minimal translation required to separate the two given Colliders. Doesn't require the Colliders to be placed at the given pose prior to the test, so is useful for writing custom character controllers.
    Terrain: Added TerrainChangedFlags for use in OnTerrainChanged message.
    Terrain: Added TerrainData.bounds for retrieving local bounding box of the terrain heightmap data.
