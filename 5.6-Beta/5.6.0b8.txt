    Android: Profiler hangs after several seconds of connection (879843)
    Android: When MuteOtherAudioSources option is disabled and there's no READ_PHONE_STATE permission, the Unity application running on Android 5.1 or older devices might not mute itself during an incoming phone call. This might cause rejections when submitting to Samsung app store.

    Editor: Editor crashes on attempt to open 5.5 compatible audio project (880653)

    Scripting: An API Updater internal error "Recursion detected while updating scripts (assembly index: 4)" is thrown when updating scripts. Note that this occurs when importing some 5.4 projects directly into 5.6 beta. One workaround is to do an intermediate import/save into 5.5. (863941)
    Services: Collab: Cannot update to latest revision if current revision has been archived and there is a conflict (857465)
    VR: [Daydream] iOS is not supported with the current native integration, but will be available in an upcoming beta release.
    VR: [Daydream] There is a memory leak when you exit and re-enter VR mode. This leak is on the native Google VR code and Google is actively working on fixing this. (859281)
    VR: [Daydream] There is no native controller integration yet. For controller use, please use the Unity SDK provided by Google.
    VR: [Daydream] You may notice that your Daydream VR display is dimmer than other VR devices. This is by design, as a means of prolonging battery life while in VR.
