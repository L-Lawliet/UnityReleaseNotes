# Contribution Guidelines

:clap: :tada: First off all thanks for contributing to us :tada: :clap:

## What we do?

We take release notes from [unity official release archive](https://unity3d.com/unity/get-unity/archive) and 
then we file them here for better search functionally using GitHub search.

You can choose one the below ways to contribute.

## Adding Release Notes

You can find missing release note from [unity official release archive](https://unity3d.com/unity/get-unity/archive) and add them to their 
related folder.

For example: If you found 1.0 or 1.0.0 is missing you should create **1.0** folder then add **1.0.0.txt** file to the folder and 
put the release notes the file.

## Fixing Release Notes

You can fix existing release notes, for example sometimes the release notes contains grammer and missing content so you find them and fix them.
