    (814402, 811236) - Graphics: Fixed image effects being rendered twice when the camera is instantiated from prefab or copying another camera. This issue was player only. 5.4 regression.
    (809864) - IL2CPP/PS4: Fixed the exception "System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: System call failed" which can occur when UDP sockets are used.
    (817745) - VR: Fixed possible crash on shutdown.

    (809995) - IL2CPP: Corrected an exception during code generation with the NPOI library.
    (808536) - iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed an error in generated C++ code due to duplicate extern declarations when an extern method in C# is overloaded.
    (818102) - IL2CPP: Renamed the types.h file to be il2cpp-string-types.h to avoid the possibility of is conflicted with a user-defined header file.
    (816514) - Linux: Don't unnecessarily clear mouse position.
    (none) - GI: Fixed performance regression of LightProbes.GetInterpolatedProbe API (5.4 regression).

    (805892) - IL2CPP/XBoxOne: Prevent the C+ compiler from crashing while compiling the IL2CPPCompilerCalculateTypeValues.cpp file for some projects. This file was just too large in these cases, so IL2CPP will not generate multiple smaller files instead.
    (812570) - IL2CPP: Properly marshal delegates when they are fields of a struct.
    (813962) - IL2CPP: Generated C++ code properly for two structs that contain arrays of each other as fields.
