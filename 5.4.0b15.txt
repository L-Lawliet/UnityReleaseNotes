Known Issues

    Crash in ::RenderGameViewCameras:: after overflowing Width or Height fields of the Game view resolution window
    In deferred rendering, light-mapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights will fallback to forward rendering.

    Shadows: Directional shadows will present shadow acne when using a custom projection matrix and a very large frustum (20k+)
    Unity crashes when calling various methods on TerrainData with boundary values
    Using OpenVR + Vive + Outdated Oculus Utils = Crash. Users are advised to update their Oculus Utils.
    VR: Image effects do not currently work with single pass rendering.
    VR: Some built-in shaders do not currently work with single pass rendering resulting in wrong transformations in right eye. Workaround is to manually include the shaders in your project.
    Windows Store: Unity APIs which use multidimensional arrays as parameters don't work on UWP when .NET Native compilation is enabled (for ex., Master config). For ex., TerrainData.SetHeights. This includes all Unity versions where UWP is supported. The bug has been logged with Microsoft.
    [GL] [Windows] Unity crashes or hangs with no respond on moving and undocking tabs
    [iOS][Metal] Performance degradation in 5.4 with some custom shaders
    [SinglePassStereo] Deferred rendering + spot and point lights stereo discrepancy
