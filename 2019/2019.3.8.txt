API Changes

2D: Added: Add GridPaintingState.brushes to allow users to get a collection of all available Grid Brushes
2D: Added: Add GridPaintingState.paletteChanged to allow users to add callbacks when the active palette has changed
2D: Added: Add GridPaintingState.palettes to allow users to get a collection of all available Palettes

Changes

2D: Make Tilemap.tilemapTileChanged and Tilemap.SyncTile public
Graphics: Changed default scripting backend of the Universal RP template to il2cpp

Improvements

Android: Update Android Logcat package version to 1.1.1

For running Unity games
Generally content developed with Unity can run pretty much everywhere. How well it runs is dependent on the complexity of your project. More detailed requirements:

Desktop:

OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
