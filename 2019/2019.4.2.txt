API Changes

iOS: Deprecated: Deprecated

UnityEngine.iOS.LocalNotification
UnityEngine.iOS.RemoteNotification
UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationServices

iOS: Following Apple's obsoletion of GKPlayer.playerID, IUserProfile.id now returns GKPlayer.teamPlayerID for devices on >= iOS 12.4 (Apple's recommended replacement) , and GKPlayer.playerID for devices below that (that won't have teamPlayerID and gamePlayerID available until they upgrade). This will impact any data that is stored using the old ID. We are working on exposing the obsolete GKPlayer.playerID to ease migration.

Changes

Timeline: Updated Timeline package to version 1.2.15

Improvements

Android: Improve performance of constant buffer memory access on Adreno devices when using Vulkan
