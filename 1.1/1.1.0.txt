New Features

    Added support for building Windows standalone player [Unity Pro feature]


    Added C/C++ plug-in support. As an example we added a MIDI plug-in with an accompanying easy-to-use Midi class (see the Manual's Plug-in documentation) [Unity Pro feature]

    Added support for an asynchronous WWW library which allows you to download textures from the web or communicate with web sites

    Levels can now be loaded from inside the editor so big games can be tested and tuned in full
    
Shaders

    Refractive glass shader added [Unity Pro feature]

    8 new virtual displacement bump-mapping shaders (sometimes known as parallax bumped)

    A number of shader fallbacks were improved

    Material color alpha is now 1 by default

Scripting

    Added gizmo drawing interface
    
    Improved level-loading interface
    
    Added GameObject.Find(string name) to get game objects by name
    
    Awake() is now called after all objects have been fully initialized
    
    Physics.OverlapSphere() now compares against the actual geometry instead of bounding box
    
    The current directory now points to the folder the player application is in for easier file access

Editor and Workflow

    Added Build menu item, which simply uses the last Build Settings for faster turn-around
    
    Scene view clip planes automatically adapt to the scene size. Zooming the scene view now behaves better for very large and very small objects
    
    Added support for importing Maya 4.5 and 5.0 files
    
    Frame selected now accounts for children of the selection

Physics

    Collision capsules can now set in which direction height is to be applied
    
    Added anisotropic friction and contact springs
    
    Sphere collider now changes radius with scale

Documentation

    Added a Scripting A Game Tutorial which walks through the creation of a full game. Another masterpiece by David Janik-Jones.
    
    Updated the Script Reference and added an overview over Unity's scripting API
    
    Rewrote script reference for transform and some other classes
    
    The documentation is now shown in browser instead of Unity
