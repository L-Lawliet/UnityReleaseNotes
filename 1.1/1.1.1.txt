New Features

    Added Capture Screenshot feature. The example in /Users/Shared/Unity/Script Tutorial/CaptureScreenshot.js shows how to make it capture a movie by writing a sequence of screenshots

    Support for Maya 7.0 .mb and .ma importing

    Performance improvements when importing .ma and .mb files

    Added Bake Simulation option to the Maya importer. This automatically bakes IK and expressions to animation curves

    Added support for directly importing Cheetah3D .jas files (requires version 2.4 of Cheetah 3D)

    Improved performance when using a lot of SendMessage. For example OverWhelmedArena now runs 50% faster

    Improved ray-casting performance

    Dashboard Widgets now have a full-screen button. They run a lot faster in full-screen mode

    Materials now import diffuse color and are better at locating the assigned texture

Shaders

    Specular highlights now look correctly on BumpSpec and Glossy kind of shaders
    
    Tangent space calculate is completely rewritten and now allows for mirrored normal maps. Note: meshes using BumpMaps must be reimported
    
    Radeon 8500-9200 shaders look a lot more like the shaders on higher end graphics cards.

Scripting

    Added isKinematic flag to the Rigidbody class
    
    Added GameObject.Find() function to find a game object by their name
    
    Coroutines will now always wait for at least one frame when using yield; or yield 0;
    
    Materials can now be assigned to guiText.material and renderer.material from scripts
    
    Coroutines can now be used as event handlers, eg. OnTriggerEnter () { yield WaitForSeconds (5); }
    
    Coroutines now keep running during level loads when marked as DontDestroyOnLoad()

Editor and Workflow

    Scene view camera improved

Bug Fixes

    Animations now no longer jump when playing the first frame

    Skinned meshes now work correctly when using offset pivot points

    Rewrote the mesh triangulator. Importing large concave polygons from 3D modellers now works correctly

    Importing FBX files with UV's from Lightwave is now more forgiving. Some Lightwave made FBX files didn't show uv's before

    Importing meshes with degenerate triangles now works correctly

    Importing of UVs is more robust now. This solves an issue when import UVs exported from Lightwave could not be imported

    Texture importer now chooses the correct texture format when importing textures that are black or white but have alpha

    Fixed 2 Blender import crash bugs

    Triangle mesh collider is more robust when using a lot of flat parts

    Screen.width and Screen.height is now correct when called from inside the editor

    Dashboard Widgets now render correctly when the monitor resolution is set to 16 bits

    Generated prefabs now correctly enforce that they can not be changed in the user interface

    Dragging a game object onto a script-property now assigns the correct instance
