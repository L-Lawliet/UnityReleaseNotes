5.4.0b10 Release Notes
Known Issues

    After expand/collapse Unity Editor window looks corrupted. If you maximize/minimize/click on windows in Editor they'll return to normal state.
    Android: UI Input requires two touches to work
    Crash in ::RenderGameViewCameras:: after overflowing Width or Height fields of the Game view resolution window
    First launch of Unity on new computer doesn't create "~/Library/Unity/Packages" folder, blocking homescreen from loading. Second launch will fix the issue
    GPU Instancing: Instancing might get broken under glcore if graphics jobs are enabled.
    In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights will fallback to forward rendering.
    On Windows with MSAA and Image Effects, game view can be rendered upside down.
    Shadows: Directional shadows will present shadow acnee when using a custom projection matrix and a very large frustum (20k+)
    Using OpenVR + Vive + Outdated Oculus Utils = Crash. Users are advised to update their Oculus Utils.
    VR: Image effects do not currently work with single pass rendering.
    VR: Single-Pass-Stereo causes some lighting problems
    VR: Some built-in shaders do not currently work with single pass rendering resulting in wrong transformations in right eye. Workaround is to manually include the shaders in your project.
    With Webplayer removal, desktop players are now part of their respective editor installations. Thus the option to separately install them is removed.
    [Billboard][LOD] Unity crashes when picking deleted Speedtree Billboard LOD level
    [IMGUI][OSX] Detached tab is not moved slightly with the cursor after opening project with changed layout in 5.4.
