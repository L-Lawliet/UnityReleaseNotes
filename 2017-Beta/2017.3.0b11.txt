Unity 2017.3.0b11 release notes
2017.3.0b11 Release Notes (diff since 2017.3.0b10)

Known Issues in 2017.3.0b11
    Android: Gradle builds fail when there are more than 250 files in streamingAssets. As a workaround, you can use a custom file extension for the files you want uncompressed. Specify this extension in a custom Gradle mainTemplate under "noCompress". You should also remove "STREAMING_ASSETS" from the template to avoid hitting the file limit. (962451)
    Facebook: Facebook Platform support throws BadImageFormatException error and prevents building. (956872)
    Universal Windows Platform: [WSA]Unity throws a System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException error when exporting to the WSA player (UWP/.NET Backend) with a Project folder that has a long path. (959984)
    XR: Editor crashes when it enters Play Mode if XR is enabled for Windows Store Apps (WSA) but there is no head-mounted display connected. (955908)
    XR: [Android] Unity throws an exception while initializing GoogleVR from the Unity library using the Gradle build system. (946104)

Changes
    Substance: Deprecated built-in support for Substance Designer materials. This support will be removed in 2018.1. To continue using Substance Designer materials in Unity 2018.1, you need to install a suitable third-party external importer from the Asset Store.
    UI: Unity no longer resets the LookDev camera when you create a new Scene. (938493)
    XR: Removed padding on double-wide texture used with Single Pass.

Improvements
    2D: If you use Shift-Click to do picking for Tile Palette, Unity now switches back to the original tool after picking is done.
    2D: Unity now displays a confirmation dialog box when you create new Tile Assets that overwrite existing Tile Assets.
    2D: Unity now saves changes to the Tile Palette when you stop editing the Tile Palette, or when you save the project.
    XR: Added XRSettings.useOcclusionMesh to allow for disabling the occlusion Mesh.
    XR: Updated Vuforia to version 7.0.34.

Fixes
    Asset Import: Fixed crash when reparenting imported root in OnPostprocessModel (943075)
    Editor: Fixed crash on Mac on window close after upding drag and drop for interacting with object picker (939211)

    UI: Fixing issue with masking setting a keyword to false when it needs to be true (958177)
    UI: Fixing issue with scale x, y = 0 not working as hit area
    UI: Fixing issue with UI profiler memory leak caused by not releasing all stored data. (955744)
    UI: Force ReapplyDrivenProperties when a RectTransform is awaking from load. (943817)
    UI: Limit size of text sent text generator to avoid it throwing an error (948059)
