Known Issues in 2017.3.0f1

    Android: Gradle builds fail when there are more than 250 files in streamingAssets. As a workaround, you can use a custom file extension for the files you want uncompressed. Specify this extension in a custom Gradle mainTemplate under "noCompress". You should also remove "STREAMING_ASSETS" from the template to avoid hitting the file limit. (962451)
