Features

    Scripting: Added command line option "overrideMonoSearchPath" for desktop standalone players (OSX, Windows). "overrideMonoSearchPath" specifies an extra folder to search when Mono is loading assemblies. One intended use is to have two versions of the same project i.e. trial and full version. The assets are the same but the scripts are different. This command line option can be used to re-use the assets but load different scripts.

Improvements

    Physics: Cloth self and inter collision tools and technology. Improved constraint painting.

API Changes

    Playables: Playable.ConnectInput now takes an optional weight parameter

Fixes

    Scripting: Fixed issue where resetting SerializedProperty.prefabOverride for one property could incorrectly reset other properties in some circumstances. (960775)
