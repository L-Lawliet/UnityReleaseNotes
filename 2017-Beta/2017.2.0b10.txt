Features

    XR: Added support for Google ARCore augmented reality technology when targeting Android 7.0 and above. The ARCore API provides accurate device position & orientation information as well as feature point detection that describes the physical space of the user's surroundings. With Unity's support for ARCore it is convenient for developers to drive a standard Unity camera using their device's real-world position & orientation, create planes representing surfaces of the device's surroundings, and render the color camera's image as the background for an augmented reality experience.

Fixes

    Collab: Fixed an issue where users could experience an editor freeze with collab enabled and 100% packet loss on network. (920583)
