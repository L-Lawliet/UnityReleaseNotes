Known Issues
    Editor: DelayedTextField will now persist the edited value when the owning window loses focus (584291, 871673, 871674, 871675, 871703)
    Editor: Inspector doesn't immeadiately reflect changes in arrays when an element is deleted (627322)

    Services: Fixed an issue in Collab where renamed files were not being uploaded with their new content (916233)

Features
    Physics: Expose a new broadphase algorithm that is based on subdividing the world boundaries and helps to overcome the performance issues in the standard sweep-and-prune approach by exluding the excess checks of bodies that are far away but overlap each other along one of the principal axis. It's called multi-box pruning and is available in the physics settings in the editor.
    Physics: Expose a setting that allows receiving the collision and trigger events from kinematic-kinematic and kinematic-static contact paris.
    XR: Added new UI to Daydream VR Device configuration to support new 6DOF standalone devices.

Changes
    2D: When a Sprite is created by importing a Texture, a default Physics Shape is generated

Improvements
    2D: Expose methods to set and retrieve Physics Shape from a Sprite
    Android: Add new way to handle audio focus in Android Oreo
    Editor: Editmode and Playmode tests producing files during its run without proper cleanup now logs a warning.
    Graphics: [Metal] Eliminate Z-fighting artifacts on certain devices
    iOS: [Metal] Improved render thread scheduling
    OSX: Fixed input configuration behaviour in launcher window, sharing code used elsewhere

API Changes
    2D: New methods for Sprite to set/retrieve Physics Shape: GetPhysicsShapeCount, GetPhysicsShapePointCount, GetPhysicsShape, OverridePhysicsShape
    Animation: Animator.CrossFade() and Animator.CrossFadeInFixedTime() can now set the transition time
    Animation: The structure AnimatorTransitionInfo now has a "duration" property that tells the duration of the current transition, as well as a "durationUnit" property that tells in which unit is expressed this duration: fixed (in seconds) or normalized (in percentage).
    Scripting: Made Vector2.SmoothDamp parameters maxSpeed and deltaTime optional
