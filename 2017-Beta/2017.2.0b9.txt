Features

    XR: Added support for Google ARCore augmented reality technology when targeting Android 7.0 and above. The Tango API provides accurate device position & orientation information as well as feature point detection that describes the physical space of the user's surroundings. With Unity's support for ARCore it is convenient for developers to drive a standard Unity camera using their device's real-world position & orientation, create planes representing surfaces of the device's surroundings, and render the color camera's image as the background for an augmented reality experience.

Changes

    Graphics: When using custom shadow resolution on a light, this resolution won't be clamped as usual, allowing to reach up to 8k shadowmap if needed.

Improvements

    XR: Improved rendering performance of Daydream and Gear VR apps.

Fixes

    Editor: Fixed crash when selecting reflection probe background color via Color Picker. (934613)
