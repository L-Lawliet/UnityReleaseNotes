Known Issues

    Audio: AudioSource attached to VideoPlayer produces choppy sound when playing certain mp4 files with VideoPlayer created from script (895458)
    Editor: "The system cannot find file specified" error while opening the project for the first time. Deleting Library folder resolves the issue. (895343)
    Editor: Editor crashes on attempt to open some 5.5 compatible audio projects. (880653)

    Graphics: Debug GFX overlay is drawn on top of objects. (851379)
    VR: Rendering problems on Pixel Daydream when using 4x or 8x MSAA with single-pass stereo. This is due to driver issues, so the problem will be addressed via a driver update, independently of Unity releases. (-)

Features

    Collab: Right Click Menu Options in the Project Browser including See Differences, Revert, Conflict Resolution
    Editor: MacOS: Support Visual Studio for Mac as an External Script Editor. Opens .sln (solution) file when double clicking a script.
    Graphics: Added RenderTextureDescriptor struct that allows you to copy and create RenderTextures by passing a single value.

Improvements

    Editor: Simplify dragging code setup: Getting rid of the requirement of setting DragAndDrop.objectReferences = new UnityEngine.Object[] {} when using DragAndDrop.SetGenericData()
    Web: It is now allowed to override User-Agent header in UnityWebRequest

API Changes

    Asset Import: Added ModelImporter.extraUserProperties
    Playables: - Changed C# Playable classes to structures: new and better approach for the API, it uses less memory and is in line with the future job system.
        Remove properties in favor of getters and setters: since we're using class extensions that can't have properties, we decided to only use methods to have a consistant API (i.e. not properties there and methods here just because reasons).
        Rename ScriptPlayableData to PlayableBehaviour: the PlayableBehaviour is the user side of the ScriptPlayable, it is where the user puts its logic.
        Documentation is in progress expect a better one in a few weeks.
