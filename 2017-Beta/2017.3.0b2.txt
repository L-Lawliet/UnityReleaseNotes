2017.3.0b2 Release Notes (Full)
Features
    Analytics: Added support to capture VR device refresh rate, dimension, aspect ratio, HMD tracking and Controllers tracking as part of device info and device status events
    Animation: Added support for integer and enum animation
    Asset Pipeline: Added AssetDatabase.ForceReserializeAssets API. This allows serialization changes to assets and metafiles caused by project upgrades to be written out seperately from regular development iterations
    Editor: Added assembly definition files feature for script compilation pipeline in the editor. Allows you to define your own managed assemblies based upon scripts inside a folder. By splitting your project's scripts into multiple assemblies, script compilation times in the editor can be greatly reduced. Note that the latest version of Visual Studio Tools for Unity is required for this feature to work with solution and project generation for Visual Studio.
    Editor: DX12 API can now be used in the Editor
    Editor: Focus events and focus ring
    Editor: MouseEnter, MouseLeave, MouseOver, MouseOut, AttachToPanel, DetachFromPanel, PostLayout events
    Editor: Transform Tool
    Facebook: Segmented uploader for Facebook platform
    GI: Added support for HDR compressed lightmaps(BC6H) on PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. The options is enabled by setting Lightmap Encoding option from Player Settings to High Quality.
    Graphics: Added Crunch compression support for ETC_RGB4 and ETC2_RGBA8 textures. Improved compression ratio and speed for DXT Crunch.
    Graphics: Added support for multisampled textures in shaders. To use a multisampled texture in a shader, declare it as Texture2DMS (or, for instance, float for a single-channel texture), and then sample as described in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn366998(v=vs.85).aspx. The corresponding RenderTexture must be created with the bindMS flag set on the RenderTextureDescriptor, or the bindTextureMS flag can be set after creation on the RenderTexture itself.
    Graphics: Adding in Dynamic Resolution as an engine feature debuting on Xbox One platform
    Graphics: Screen snaps shots can now target an Image, not for a file.
    Graphics: Support for 32 bit Mesh index buffers:
       By default meshes larger than 65k vertices will get imported with a 32 bit index buffer; smaller meshes still use 16 bit indices.
       Added "Index Format" setting to mesh importer to override this behavior.
       Added Mesh.indexFormat to scripting API for meshes created at runtime.
    Kernel: New argument: -systemallocator Disable managing of allocations in engine and use system allocations. Useful when using external tools for memory debugging.
    Particles: Added Unlit and Surface shaders for use with Particle Systems
    Particles: Control particle speeds without changing their directions, using a new option in the Velocity Module.
    Particles: Ribbonized Particle Trails
    Physics: Expose a new broadphase algorithm that is based on subdividing the world boundaries and helps to overcome the performance issues in the standard sweep-and-prune approach by exluding the excess checks of bodies that are far away but overlap each other along one of the principal axis. It's called multi-box pruning and is available in the physics settings in the editor.
    Physics: Expose a setting that allows receiving the collision and trigger events from kinematic-kinematic and kinematic-static contact paris.
    Physics: Expose MeshCollider cooking options that allow for much shorter cooking time. Requires the input data to be checked for validity manually.
    Playables: New delay feature for the IPlayables
    Playables: New Video Playables Integration
    Profiler: Added API for custom threads profiling - Profiling.BeginThreadProfiling/EndThreadProfiling
    Scripting: Add Mono/.NET 2.0 support for Memory Profiler (https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/memoryprofiler)
    Services: Performance Reporting Service: Added support for MacOS native crashes.
    Video: Movie encoding bindings in UnityEngine.Media to expose the VideoClipImporter encoders. Will be used for recording.
    Video: Panoramic 360/180 2D/3D video workflows
    XR: Add XR support to Experimental Scriptable Render Pipelines
    XR: Added new UI to Daydream VR Device configuration to support new 6DOF standalone devices.

Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes
    Graphics: DirectX 9 support has been removed from Windows Editor & Standalone. See blog post.

    Graphics: Remove Allegorithmic texture compressor
    Graphics: Updated splash screen logo with new branding style.
    Graphics: When using custom shadow resolution on a light, this resolution won't be clamped as usual, allowing to reach up to 8k shadowmap if needed.

    Package Manager: Add "upmResetToEditorDefaults" command-line option and menu item to reset packages to Editor defaults
    Profiler: Improved profiler data serialization for Players - lower memory overhead, better performance
    Shaders: Concatenated matrix macros (e.g. UNITY_MATRIX_MVP) are now changed to static variables to avoid repeated calculations.
    XR: Improvements to the way that XR devices can pause/unpause applications, particular with respect to pausing from application focus lost. Overlapping pause conditions are now handled correctly, regardless of the order in which they occur.

Improvements
    2D: Expose methods to set and retrieve Physics Shape from a Sprite
    Android: Add new way to handle audio focus in Android Oreo
    Android: Added a possibility to configure texture decompression format on Android devices that have no ETC2 texture format support.

    Android: [OpenGL ES] Added support for preserving the framebuffer alpha
    Animation: Added a 2D mode to the Animation Previewer
    Animation: Added new Translation DoFs for Arms, Legs and Head for Humanoid animation and retargeting. It converts translations (aka stretch) found on imported animation to retargetable Humanoid animation.
    Animation: Entry, Exit and AnyState StateMachine Transitions can now be copy-pasted (921705)
    Animation: Framing a single key does not give proper context for manipulation in the curve editor, so we include neighbouring keys.

    Asset Import: Added "Preserve Hierarchy" toggle to ModelImporter to prevent root transform from being stripped when model has a single root.
    Asset Import: Video clip transcoding happening during import can now be skipped if the user wants to, leading to a non-transcoded version of the video being used instead.
    DX12: Native Rendering Plugin improvements - exposed/implemented native RenderBuffer resource retrieval, fixed multithreading issues
    Editor: Added UnityEngine.Networking.PlayerConnection.ConnectedPlayer.Name, it will let identify connected players easier

    Graphics: Added non-allocating overloads for GeometryUtility.CalculateFrustumPlanes
    Graphics: Adding GPU selection in metal MacEditor/MacStandalonePlayer
    Graphics: GPU Instancing: Now instance properties are packed as arrays of structures.
       That means internally we changed the constant buffer layout where multiple instance properties are present.
       You don't have to do much to adopt the new tech. There are three changes in the instancing declaration macros, but the old shaders can be upgraded automatically.
       For your reference, the three changes are:
       UNITY_INSTANCING_CBUFFER_START/END are renamed to UNITY_INSTANCING_BUFFER_START/END.
       UNITY_INSTANCING_BUFFER_END now takes an arrayName in the parentheses.
       UNITY_ACCESS_INSTANCED_PROP now must be provided with the arrayName in the first argument to indicate where this property comes from.
       The CPU-side processing of instance property values are optimized and off-loaded to worker thread (if graphics jobs are not enabled) to further reduce CPU cost.
    Graphics: Improved documentation for graphics hardware tiers
    Graphics: Improved motion vectors precision when dynamic batching is disabled
