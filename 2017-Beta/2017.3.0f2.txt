Unity 2017.3.0f2 release notes
2017.3.0f2 Release Notes (diff since 2017.3.0f1)

Known Issues in 2017.3.0f2

    Android: Gradle builds fail when there are more than 250 files in streamingAssets. As a workaround, you can use a custom file extension for the files you want uncompressed. Specify this extension in a custom Gradle mainTemplate under "noCompress". You should also remove "STREAMING_ASSETS" from the template to avoid hitting the file limit. (962451)

    Editor: MonoDevelop might get corrupted on macOS. Workaround is to rename MonoDevelop.app to something else like MonoDevelop2.app and then back to MonoDevelop.app again. This will make MonoDevelop work again. (969131)

    Universal Windows Platform: [WSA]Unity throws a System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException error when exporting to the WSA player (UWP/.NET Backend) with a Project folder that has a long path. (959984)

    XR: [Android] Unity throws an exception while initializing GoogleVR from the Unity library using the Gradle build system. (946104)
