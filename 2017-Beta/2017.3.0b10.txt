2017.3.0b10 Release Notes (diff since 2017.3.0b9)

Known Issues in 2017.3.0b10
    Android: Gradle builds fail when there are more than 250 files in streamingAssets. Can be workarounded by using a custom file extension for the files you want uncompressed. This extension should be specified in a custom gradle mainTemplate under "noCompress". You should also remove "STREAMING_ASSETS" from the template to avoid hitting the file limit. (962451)
