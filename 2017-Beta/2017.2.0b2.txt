Features

    2D: Added Tilemap.
    Asset Import: Added support for animated custom properties from FBX.
    Asset Import: Added support for Stingray material import from FBX.
    Editor: Added assembly definition files feature for script compilation pipeline in the editor. Allows you to define your own managed assemblies based upon scripts inside a folder. By splitting your project's scripts into multiple assemblies, script compilation times in the editor can be greatly reduced. Note that the latest version of Visual Studio Tools for Unity is required for this feature to work with solution and project generation for Visual Studio.
    GI: Added support for per-object cast and receive shadows in the Progressive Lightmapper. For Cast Shadows, only On and Off options are supported.
    GI: Per-object lightmap seam stitching for Progressive Lightmapper.
    GI: Profiler for Realtime Global Illumination.
    GI: Support for double-sided materials in Progressive Lightmapper. Added a new material setting that causes lighting to interact with backfaces. When enabled, both sides of the geometry get accounted for when calculating Global Illumination. Backfaces do not count as invalid when seen from other objects. Backface rendering is not controlled by this setting nor will backfaces be represented in the lightmaps. Backfaces bounce light using the same emission and albedo as frontfaces.
    Graphics: Implemented Display-P3 color gamut support for iOS and macOS. A "color gamut" player setting has been added, which will eventually cover other platforms with wide color gamut support.
    Multiplayer: New QoS options for delivery of large messages: reliable or unreliable, and un-ordered (fragmented) or ordered (fragmented sequenced).
    OSX: Added support for Retina in macOS standalone builds.
    PackMan: In 2017.2, we are introducing Unity Package Manager. This will be the first stepping stone for the system. We are taking an incremental approach to integrate the system into the Unity ecosystem. It will grow with more features over time. For this first release, we avoid exposing user facing features. Instead, we are exposing an API for enabling internal components to be updated more frequently than the editor (the first pillar of the system).
    Particles: Add new option to allow Particle Systems to be destroyed or disabled when they finish playing.
    Particles: Added Linear Drag support for Particles. The new options can be found in the Limit Velocity over Lifetime Module.
    Services: Performance Reporting Service: Added support for native crashes on Android.
    Timeline: Added support for Avatar Masks on Animation Tracks.
    Video: Added pixel aspect ratio support for non-square pixel.
    WebGL: Added linear rendering to WebGL 2.0
    XR: Added support for Google Tango augmented reality technology when targeting Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and above. The Tango API provides accurate device position information as well as depth data that describes the physical space of the user's surroundings. With Unity's support for Tango it is convenient for developers to drive a standard Unity camera using their device's real-world position, create 3D meshes representing the device's surroundings, and render the color camera's image as the background for an augmented reality experience.
    XR: Added support for Video Async Reprojection. Video Async Reprojection allows an app to feed video frames directly into the Google VR Async Reprojection system. These frames are composited directly into the scene without going through the main Unity render loop. This provides a fast path to direct rendering of video regardless of the current frame rate Unity is rendering at. When using Async Video Reprojection, texture filtering is skipped providing for a much higher quality output. There is an option to allow for the use of protected memory for users that need to render DRM protected content.
    XR: Added support for Windows Mixed Reality as a Virtual Reality SDK target. This extends Unity's HoloLens support so that it more generally supports Windows Mixed Reality, both for desktop and HoloLens.
    XR: Certain aspects of the Vive HMD can be simulated in Editor, without the need of a physical HMD, using the "Mock HMD - Vive" virtual reality SDK in the player settings. The mock HMD will use the same asymmetric projection matrix, hidden occlusion mesh, field of view, aspect ratio, and eye texture size as the Vive. Mock HMD can be used with both multi and single pass rendering paths. Mock HMD will render as a split screen stereo display in Editor.
    XR: Introduced native integration for the Vuforia Augmented Reality Platform: additional feature support will follow in later beta updates. Vuforia support can be installed through the Unity Download Assistant and enabled under PlayerSettings/XR. For more information about Vuforia see https://developer.vuforia.com.
    XR: Windows Mixed Reality headsets are now supported for playing in-editor.

Changes

    Android: Changed default frame rate (Application.targetFrameRate 0) to 30 when v-sync is off, similar to iOS.
    Audio: AudioMixer ducking improvements:
        Optimized CPU performance.
        Changed behaviour so that ducking amount corresponds to the maximum level on each channel.
    Editor: 2017 Editor requires a new license version. Subscription keys will be upgraded, but 5.x license keys will not be accepted by 2017 Editor. If you have only a 5.x license, please visit https://store.unity.com/ or contact your sales representative to obtain a 2017-compatible license.
    Editor: APIUpdater no longer runs automatically when Editor runs in batch mode. See -accept-apiupdate command argument for more information.
    Editor: Changed the behaviour of the "members" button in the Collab toolbar: it now opens a page in the web dashboard to add/remove project members.
    Editor: Editor GUI tooltips are no longer suspended if the scene is paused in Play mode.
    Editor: Reduced the verbosity in editor log for script recompilation.
    Scripting: Editor: Load precompiled managed assemblies (.dlls) and assembly definition file assemblies on startup even if there are compile errors in other scripts.
    Scripting: UnityEngine.dll is now split into separate dlls for each UnityEngine module.
    Scripting: InitializeOnLoad now invoked after deserialization. See Upgrade guide for details.
    Scripting: MonoBehaviour.OnValidate is now called when adding a MonoBehaviour to a game object in the editor.
    UI: The legacy (Unity 1.0) UI system components - GUILayer, GUIText, and GUITexture - have been marked as deprecated. GUILayer components are no longer added to the camera by default.
    Universal Windows Platform: The default scripting backend on Universal Windows Platform has changed to IL2CPP.

Improvements

    AI: Debug data from the process of building a NavMesh with the NavMeshBuilder API can be selectively collected and visualized in the Editor using NavMeshEditorHelpers.DrawBuildDebug().
    AI: Improved performance when synchronizing NavMesh tiles after carving.
    Android: Significantly improved the performance of large prefabs loading (Resources.Load* or AssetBundle.LoadAsset* APIs) on Android.
    Android: The backend ETC texture compressor is now configurable in the Editor Settings with different quality/compression speed tradeoffs.
    Animation: Added copy pasting of transition parameters in Animator State Machine.
    Animation: Added option to Animator States to pull normalized time from a specified Parameter rather than using Time.deltaTime.
    Asset Import: Minor impovements to the Avatar Mask and Transform Mask UI.
    Asset Import: Parallelized the animation clip keyframe reduction during import.
    Asset Import: Updated SketchUp SDK to 17.0
    Audio: Added ability to get and set the audio spatializer from script via AudioSettings.GetSpatializerPluginName and AudioSettings.SetSpatializerPluginName.
    Editor: Added toggle for color-blind safe mode to the context menu in the upper right corner of the Profiler window.

    GI: Added A-Trous, a new edge-aware filter for GI when using the Progressive Lightmapper.
    GI: Added support for LOD baking in Progressive Lightmapper.
    GI: Asynchronous loading of precomputed realtime GI data, by moving the GI part of file I/O into the loading thread. Exposed DynamicGI.IsConverged to public API so user can know when lighting is converged. Timesliced albedo-emission rendering during load.
    GI: Fill the empty areas in the lightmaps with content from the lower mip levels (push-pull dilation). This will fix the cases where dark pixels around geometry edges are visible when rendering with lightmaps. The is due to dark background texels bleeding in when lower MIPs are accessed.
    GI: HDR emission: enabled 16 bit floating point format for emission for both realtime and baked GI. Baked GI output is still limited by RGBM range. HDR color picker limit increased from 99 to 64k.
    GI: Terrain trees can now cast shadows into the baked lightmap for terrains. Terrain tree probes are now in the top of the tree canopy to make sure probes don't end up inside the tree trunk.
    GI: Upgraded the Enlighten SDK to 3.09. New since 3.08p1: Improvements:
        The face(s) of a triangle which cast direct light shadows can now be set per material. Bug Fixes:
        Fixed a bug where setting the update manager limiter to values greater than 0 produced incorrect reading of the input lighting buffers.
        Fixed a crash in IPrecompute::PackGeometry() when providing an input mesh with very large UVs.

    Physics: Added edit modes for joint angular limits to inspectors for CharacterJoint, ConfigurableJoint, HingeJoint, and HingeJoint2D.
    Physics: Collision2D.contacts array is now created lazily so as to not allocate memory until used.
    Plugins: Added a rendering command buffer callback to update the contents of a texture from inside the plugin (D3D11/Metal/GLES).
    Shaders: Improved compute shader import times and eliminated some shader compiler timeouts.
    Shaders: Improved import time of surface shaders with many similar shader_feature/multi_compile variants.
    UI: Introduced a shader keyword to all of the UI shaders, which controls the rect clipping. Rect clipping is only done when the mask component is enabled. This leads to much better UI performance when masks are not used.
    VR: Updated Oculus to version 1.14
    Web: UnityWebRequesst now has DownloadHandlerFile available for downloading files and saving them to disk with low memory footprint.
    Windows: The crash dialog in the Windows Player has been improved with more detail, and prompts the user to open an Explorer window to the crash report.
