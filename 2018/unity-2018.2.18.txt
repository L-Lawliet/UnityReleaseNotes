Release notes
Fixes

Android: Fixed crash on Android 9. (1102065)
Editor: Fixed function keys incorrectly producing characters within input fields. (1057122)
Editor: Fixed issue with precompiled managed assemblies (.dlls) in the Assets folder getting loaded twice on startup, causing two InitializeOnLoad calls where Unity API calls such as AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath would fail in the first InitializeOnLoad. Now there is only one first InitializeOnLoad call and Unity APIs work as expected. (1060352)

Graphics: Fixed RGBA4444 texture support when using OpenGL ES. (1077689, 1079024)
IL2CPP: Fixed the marshalling of char arrays to be two byte characters when CharSet.Unicode is used. This corrects the behavior of some Windows Registry assemblies. (1086670)

IMGUI: Fixed Unity Editor no longer automatically unlocking assembly reload. (960397)
