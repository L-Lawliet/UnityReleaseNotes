Package Manager: Fixed a permission-related issue on Windows where creating the upm.log file would fail when the process was being run with a system account.

Package Manager: Fixed an issue where a "dest already exists" error could occur during package resolution. This is because older versions of upm using the npm Javascript library could sometimes leave empty folders inside the npm cache.
