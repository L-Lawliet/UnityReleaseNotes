Graphics: Fixed an issue where unbound UAVs in shaders would cause the Editor to crash. (988911, 1098906)
Graphics: Fixed appdata not zero-initialized in domain shader causing compiler error about out parameter not being fully initialized.
Graphics: Fixed edge/inside tesselation factors being improperly handled. (1065883)
Graphics: Fixed shader translation of RWTexture2D. (1103036)
Graphics: Fixed vertex/hull shader program translation into a tessellation compute kernel when there is no vertex input. (1086957)
IL2CPP: Fixed crash when using StructLayout attribute and specifying a Pack value. (1099207)
IL2CPP: Fixed not checking the managed thread id at thread creation time to prevent it from being overwritten if it has already been set. (1101331)
iOS: Make "textures used in draw call" use our hash_set instead of std::set. (1061553)
