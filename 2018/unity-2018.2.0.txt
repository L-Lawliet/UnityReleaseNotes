Features

2D: Add option to SpriteRenderer to allow sorting of SpriteRenderer by its center or by its pivot point
2D: Added support for hexagonal layout for Grid component.
Android: Add command line option "-setDefaultPlatformTextureFormat" to set the default texture format prior to importing or building, allowing the user to avoid importing twice: Once for the system default texture format then a second time for the desired format. Only Android is currently supported. Expects a single parameter from: dxt, pvrtc, atc, etc, etc2, astc.
Android: Added support for using Java source files as plugins in Unity project. These files will be compiled and included into APK.

Added keyboard navigation in the Packages list
Moved menu item to access the Package Manager UI window from "Project -> Packages -> Manage" to "Window -> Package Manager".
The "Install" tab now shows the latest version (and description) available for each package, rather than the current version.
The "Update to" button is no longer displayed when the current version is the same as (or greater than) the latest one available.
The UI now displays "alpha", "beta", "experimental" and "recommended" tags for packages, as appropriate.  Previous versions did not display such tags, so it was not possible to determine the status of packages.
UI polish.

Package Manager: Support Packages assets in Asset Database search and Object selector
Package Manager: Support Packages in Project Browser

Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

2D: ISpriteEditor has a new interface method GetMainVisualContainer to allow adding UIElements for GUI controls
Android: Moved all Android icons to 'mipmap' folder
Android: Removed PVRScope support
Editor: Gtk+ 3.4+ is now required to run the Unity editor on Linux
Editor: When importing PSD, we no longer tweak its colors to remove white matte color impact. That means that texture colors will look exactly same as if image was "flattened" in Photoshop (alpha is kept intact)
Graphics: Vulkan now always uses RenderTextureFormat.ARGBHalf as RenderTextureFormat.DefaultHDR. Before RenderTextureFormat.ARGBFloat, if supported, was used on desktop platforms.
IMGUI: Added TreeView.getNewSelectionOverride. This override is required in order to support selection via clicking/keyboard while building only the visible rows.
iOS: As we dropped support for pre-iOS8, we no longer need two codepaths in orientation handling.
Multiplayer: The deprecated legacy networking APIs have been removed
Package Manager: Previous versions of Unity used to rely on a predetermined set of packages to get loaded automatically into every project. As of 2018.2, only packages that are listed in the manifest.json file of the project are loaded. To make this happen, a project manifest migration script is applied to existing projects when first opening it in 2018.2 (beta8+).
This change was made to allow more flexibility in managing core Editor packages. It also makes the package configuration more explicit since it is now clear, by looking at manifest.json, what packages are part of the project.
Profiler: Added automatic creation of label on recorder creation (881136)
Universal Windows Platform: Deprecated AppCallbacks::AddCommandLineArg() and AppCallbacks::ParseCommandLineArgsFromFiles(). You now must pass command line arguments into AppCallbacks constructor. In addition, we also deprecated PlayerSettings.WSA.commandLineArgsFile API in the editor. (1001513)
Universal Windows Platform: Removed "-forceTextBoxBasedKeyboard" command line argument.
Universal Windows Platform: Removed support for old Windows Phone devices (the ones with pre-DX10 GPU, i.e. everything older than Adreno 4xx).
WebGL: Allow WebAssembly heap to grow
WebGL: Configured toolchain so it does not generate WebAssembly trapping instructions.
WebGL: Enable Data Caching option in new projects
WebGL: Upgraded toolchain to emscripten 1.37.33 and binaryen 42
WebGL: WebAssembly is the default Linker Target on new projects
XR: Standalone applications which target and require Windows Mixed Reality will now always attempt to initialize the device, even if no HMD is connected or the Mixed Reality OS component is not installed (rather then falling back to flat desktop mode.) This will cause the OS to display a dialog indicating that the user needs to connect a device and install the OS component.

Changes

Android: WebCamTexture is implemented using android.hardware.camera2 package for devices which support API level 21
Animation: Linear presets now use Auto tangents, for better initial behavior when dragging the keys
Editor: Added options for better behaviour when script compilation is triggered while the editor is playing. You can choose between them in Preferences>General>Script Changes While Playing
Graphics: Added 'physical camera mode' to the camera component with sensor size, focal length and lens shift properties.
Particles: Moved "Show Only Selected" (aka Solo Mode) option to the Scene View Overlay, from the Particle System popout Window, so it is more discoverable.

Editor: Improvement to UIElements contextual menu:

Menu separators can now be added to sub-menus.
Menu actions callbacks receive the selected menu item as a parameter instead of the event. You can retrieve event information in menuItem.eventInfo.
You can provide user data to menu action. You can retrieve it in your action callbacks using menuItem.userData.

Breaking API changes:

menu action callbacks now takes a ContextualMenu.MenuAction parameter instead of an EventBase parameter.
ContextualMenu.InsertSeparator takes an additional string parameter.

Editor: Improvements to Profiler Timeline view, allowing for vertical scrolling and resizing of thread heights

Editor: Test Runner window: Run All and Run Selected always run tests respecting the currently selected name and category fixes
Editor: Users can override the selection outliner if they add this pass. Tags{ "LightMode" = "SceneSelectionPass" } Should return: return float4(_ObjectId, _PassValue, 1, 1);
GI: Cache a LightingData asset when baking in auto mode, so scripts in play mode switching to an auto-baked scene can recover all GI data
GI: Reduced memory usage while baking with Progressive Lightmapper when using many instances.
Graphics: Add LOD fade support for particles/lines/trails
Graphics: Added GetNames function to ShaderKeywordSet C# API to return the list of shader keyword as strings
Graphics: Added Render.GetMaterials and Render.GetSharedMaterials that take List as argument
Graphics: Added SetInt, GetInt to MaterialPropertyBlock (970490)
Graphics: Added support for up to 8 UVs for model import, Mesh API and in shaders. The previous maximum was 4.
Graphics: Added Texture2D.GetRawTextureData overload that returns a direct NativeArray into texture's pixel data. This allows runtime pixel data modification without an extra memory copy of SetPixels32 or LoadRawTextureData. (1015723)
Graphics: Adding state into RenderingCommandBuffer. Allows executing same CommandBuffer with multiple lights
Graphics: Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced and Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect now can be rendered in ForwardAdd pass. Use "forwardadd" in instancing_option directive to generate the instanced ForwardAdd pass.

API Changes

2D: A new experimental API, UnityEngine.Experimental.U2D.PixelPerfectRendering.pixelSnapSpacing, was added to facilitate pixel perfect rendering of 2D sprites.
2D: Added CRUD API for Sprite Atlas, all in UnityEditor.U2D.
2D: Experimental API TextureGenerator.GenerateTexture now takes in a NativeArrray for image buffer instead of setting a IntPtr in TextureGenerationSettings
2D: Setting UnityEngine.Experimental.U2D.PixelPerfectRendering.pixelSnapSpacing to a positive value no longer causes the movement of the sprites to be snapped.
2D: Sprite.Create has been overloaded to take in an extra argument "generateFallbackPhysicsShape" which will generate a physics shape for the sprite if set
AI: Change structure name in the Experimental API for Navmesh Queries from PolygonID to PolygonId.
AI: New experimental API for NavMesh queries, usable within C# jobs: namespace UnityEngine.Experimental.AI; struct PolygonID; struct NavMeshLocation; enum PathQueryStatus; enum NavMeshPolyTypes; struct NavMeshWorld; struct NavMeshQuery with these functions: BeginFindPath(), UpdateFindPath(), EndFindPath(), GetPathResult(), IsValid(), GetAgentTypeIdForPolygon(), MapLocation(), GetPortalPoints(), MoveLocations(), MoveLocation(), PolygonLocalToWorldMatrix(), PolygonWorldToLocalMatrix(), GetPolygonType(), Dispose().
Animation: Refined the experimental Anim C# Jobs API, renamed and changed some fields in AnimationStream and AnimationHumanStream (e.g. IsValid() becomes isValid, GetBodyLocalPosition() becomes bodyLocalPosition, 'DoF' renamed to 'Dof', etc.)
Asset Import: Added AssetImportContext.DependsOnSourceAsset to make it possible to report source dependencies during imports, in ScriptedImporters.
Asset Import: Changed the localID output argument of AssetDatabase.TryGetGUIDAndLocalFileIdentifier from int to long. Using an int might cause overflows if used on objects with localids over INT_MAX, which can happen on objects attached to prefabs.
Asset Pipeline: Deprecate AssetDatabase.TryGetGUIDAndLocalFileIdentifier with int localID parameter, use the overload of this function that uses a long data type for the localId parameter, because this version can return a localID that has overflowed. This can happen when called on objects that are part of a Prefab.
Editor: Added AssemblyBuilder.defaultReferences and AssemblyBuilder.defaultDefines read-only properties
Editor: Added Editor.finishedDefaultHeaderGUI event to inject additional controls into Inspector header
Editor: KeyDown events receiving a KeyCode and KeyUp events are now used by text fields in the Editor when the user is entering text. Previously they only used KeyDown events producing printable characters. If you have controls that draw after a text field that need to be aware of these events, you should test for them before drawing the text field.
Graphics: Camera.focalLength
Camera.sensorSize
Camera.lensShift
Camera.usePhysicalProperties
Graphics: Removed the implicit power slider behavior from _Shininess properties on user-defined shaders. If you need old behaviour back you can add the attribute [PowerSlider(5.0)]  in front of the property.
[PowerSlider(5.0)] _NameOfVar ("Name Of Variable", Range (0.01, 1)) = 0.078125
This will give the _NameOfVar a slider that is a power slider. (965967)
Graphics: Rendering.CommandBuffer.SetRenderTarget overloads that accept RenderBufferLoadAction, RenderBufferStoreAction
Package Manager: Expose package keywords in Package Manager C# API
Playables: Rename SetInputPort to SetOutputPort. Added the traversal mode option (Mix, or Passthrough)

Timeline: Timeline.TimelineEditor.inspectedAsset
Timeline.TimelineEditor.masterAsset
Timeline.TimelineEditor.inspectedDirector
Timeline.TimelineEditor.masterDirector
Timeline: Timeline.TimelineEditor.timelineAsset - Reason: Ambiguous - Replaced by: inspectedAsset and masterAsset
Timeline.TimelineEditor.playableDirector - Reason: Ambiguous - Replaced by: inspectedDirector and masterDirector
UI: New API for disabling Undo on DrivenRectTransform to stop and resume recording undo actions on Driven RectTransforms.
Video: MovieTexture - MovieImporter have been marked as deprecated.
