5.5.0b1 Release Notes
Release Date 30 August 2016
System Requirements Changes

    OSX 10.8 will be dropped (not done as of yet)
    Samsung TV 2013 and 2014 will be dropped

Known Issues

    Animation: Animation Clip importer crashes when using Avatar for a mismatching hierarchy.
    Editor: Editor is not redrawing when changing to certain layouts (822106)
    Editor: KeyNotFoundException thrown on adding prefab to scene. (826474)
    Graphics: Opening a pre-Unity 5.5 project with Unity 5.5 will set it to forward rendering for all tiers (see Graphics settings/Tier settings), even if the previous project was set to deferred rendering. (826486)
    iOS: il2cpp builds for iOS 8.4.1 crash (823808)
    Scripting: C# scripts may not get updated by ScriptUpdater in some scenarios (816066)
    Terrain: Editor hangs for several seconds when painting SpeedTrees in a new project (823603)

Features

    Editor: New selection highlighting in scene view.
    Instead of showing a wireframe a selection outline is now shown. This outline color can be configured in the preferences of Unity. In the gizmo / annotation window you can select if you would like this behavour, the old behaviour, or both.
    Editor: Option to run Cache Server locally for quick platform switching
    Particles: New Modules:
        Lights Module, for adding realtime lights to particles
        Noise Module, for adding Curl Noise to Particle Movement
        Trails Module, for rendering ribbonized trails behind particles
    Physics: New CapsuleCollider2D
    SceneManager: Editor SceneSet asset.
    When creating a SceneSet asset in the editor it will save the current list of open scenes so that this set of scenes can be easily restored.
    Scripting: Built-in support for opening scripts in Visual Studio Code as an external script editor on OSX and Windows. Unity will now detect when Visual Studio Code is selected an external script editor and pass the correct arguments to it when opening scripts from Unity and setup a default .vscode/settings.json with file excludes, if it does not already exist.
    Shaders: Per-rendertarget blend modes. New shader syntax: "Blend N Src Dst", "BlendOp N Op", "ColorMask Mask N", where N is the render target index (0..7). This feature works on DX11/12, GLCore, Metal, PS4.

Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

    DX9: DX9 half-pixel offset adjustments are now done at shader compilation time. This means that shaders no longer need to do any UNITY_HALF_TEXEL_OFFSET checks, and any possible C# code for coordinate adjustment no longer needs to happen on DX9. However, vertex shader constant register #255 (c255) is reserved by Unity now, and all vertex shaders get two instructions automatically added to do the adjustment.
    JSONUtility: EditorJsonUtility now serializes object references by assetGUID/fileID rather than InstanceID, making the serialized data stable across Editor sessions
    OpenGL: Legacy desktop OpenGL2 support was removed. It was already not the default in 5.3, and deprecated in 5.4. This only affects Mac & Linux.
    WebGL: WebGL no longer supports loading LZMA compressed AssetBundles, as that is very inefficient - it's use was alway discouraged, but is now disabled

Changes

    Android: IL2CPP - Use Android NDK x64 on x64 Windows Editor
    BuildPlayer: Building of a player will fail if the project does not build in the editor
    Core: Changed the obsoleteness warning message of Undo.RegisterUndo to suggest the correct replacement.
    Editor: Added support for resizing the height of the preferences window
    Editor: Removed fading/lerping behaviour when dragging/docking views because it was ugly at best, and sometimes visually confusing.
    Graphics: Add a fatal error if the player is force-run with a renderer that it wasn't built for from the editor.
    Graphics: Removed logic that tried to downscale shadow resolution based on a guess on how much free VRAM was available at the time.
    Graphics: Warnings are shown when a renderer that statically batched is going to be rendered instanced.
    Physics: Expose Physics.queriesHitBackfaces. Off by default, so all physics queries would NOT detect hits with backface triangles. Previously, some queries would detect, and some wouldn't, which was inconsistent.
    Physics: The breakForce reported by the OnJointBreak callback will now be the original breakForce, regardless of the Joint was disabled and re-enabled during the callback cycle
    Physics: The Physics system will now reject meshes containing non-finite vertices
    Samsung TV: Support for 2013 and 2014 TVs has been dropped. Deploying to these two years of TV will no longer work.
    Shadows: Unity does not reduce shadowMap size automaticaly from VRAM anymore.
    WebGL: Will now write asm.js code in separate file for normal js, which allows for better memory optimizations in Firefox

Improvements

    Android: IL2CPP - Full debug version of IL2CPP libraries are stored in Temp/StagingArea/Il2Cpp/Native
    Android: IL2CPP - Stripping of symbols and debug info is now enabled by default. Development builds still has symbols which makes for a slightly larger binary
    Android: SoftInput - Get rid of hardcoded text color, switch to Light theme
    Android: Symbols for release libraries are now available in PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/Variantions/*/Release/Symbols
    Animation: Added a new default ClipAnimationMaskType to the animation importer: None. This value should be used when you do not need a mask
    Animation: In the Clip Importer, AvatarMask will be now set to None by default when importing new FBX files
    Build Pipeline: Optimized the build pipeline so that asset bundles that contain scene files don't have to recompile the scripts every time. This results in a much quicker build process.
    Cache Server: Upgraded the node.js version used by the Cache Server to version 0.12.7
    DX9: Fixed various half-pixel offset issues when using Direct3D 9. Now rendering matches other platforms (DX11, OpenGL etc.) exactly.
    Editor: Add Unity version to main editor window title bar (makes it easy to see which Unity version you currently have open)
    Editor: Added 'Discard changes' in scene context menu in the Hierarchy: Reloads selected modified scenes from disk
    Editor: Area lights now indicate their effective range in the inspector.
    Editor: EditorGUIUtility.ObjectContent now adds type information to the text string as shown for ObjectFields: E.g: "Concrete (Texture2D)" instead "Concrete".
    Editor: In SceneView, hide wireframe on objects with the hideInHierarchy flag (previously it would show when the object's parent was selected).
    Editor: It is now possible to dock views to the tops of windows and other views. Previously only left, right and bottom were possible.
    Editor: Undo support for Sorting Layers
    GI: Pass custom properties when rendering GI meta pass.
    Graphics: Added RenderTexture.GenerateMips script API for manual control over mipmap generation. Reanmed existing RenderTexture.generateMips property to autoGenerateMips.
    Graphics: Added support for importing textures as RGBAHalf (16 bits float per component)
        Added 'HDR' texture format for automatic HDR format choice (RGBAHalf for Desktop/PS4/XBoxOne and the usual RGBM, dLDR depending on the platform)
        Reflection probes now default to this new HDR format
    Graphics: Added Texture conversion to RenderTargetIdentifier so that SetGlobalTexture actually accepts textures.
    Graphics: Added the ability of batching renderers of different LOD fade values together by using "lodfade" option in instancing_options directive.
    Graphics: GPU Instancing: Implemented SpeedTree instancing
        Still light probes are not allowed.
    Graphics: Improved LODGroup component UI:
        Now the sliding Camera icon is aware of the global LOD bias value and works acoordingly.
        The "Recalculate Bounds" button now only gets enabled when clicking it has a change.
    Graphics: Line/Trail Renderer rendering has been improved.
    Graphics: Metal (iOS/macOS) can render into slices of 3D and 2DArray textures now.
    Graphics: Textures can now be imported to two new formats:
        BC6H for high quality compressed RGB HDR textures
        BC7 for high quality compressed RGB(A) textures Those formats are currently only available on desktop (DX11+, GLCore), PS4 and Xbox One platforms.
        On those platforms, HDR textures will now default to FP16 for uncompressed texture and BC6H for compressed textures.
        Reflection probes behave the same way (uncompressed => FP16, compressed => BC6H)
        BC7 will be chosen automatically by the texture importer for texture setup as "High Quality Compressed" on supported platforms (see texture importer refactoring)
        Note: DX9 and MacGL do not support those formats. If a texture is set as BC6H it will be automatically uncompressed to FP16 and BC7 will be uncompressed to RGBA8
    Graphics: Visualize command buffers attached to Lights, add buttons for removing each/all of them
    IL2CPP: Reduce the binary size and build time for projects which make use of many C# attributes.
    IMGUI: Event.Use() method logs a warning if event type is Repaint or Layout
    iOS: Added an option for users to disable the filtering of emojis in the iOS keyboard via the trampoline code
    iOS/tvOS: Significantly reduce the size of shipped static libraries
    iOS/tvOS: Use relative symlinks for plugins when building to related folder
    JSONUtility: EditorJsonUtility now allows any object type to be passed in for serialization, not just UnityEngine.Object types, so that vanilla C# types can take advantage of the object reference serialization behaviour.
    JsonUtility: JsonUtility.ToJson is now faster and uses less temporary memory.
    OSX/iOS Metal: Add -force-metal switch to force Metal rendering on OSX/iOS
    Particles: Added 'Show Bounds' to Particle System UI. Shows the world and local AABB for the system.
    Particles: Added new option to rotate particles to face their initial direction of travel
    Particles: Added new render mode to make particle billboards face the eye position (good for VR)
    Particles: Gradients now support a fixed color mode, where no blending is performed. Useful when users want to define a simple list of possible colors to be chosen from.
    Particles: Gravity Modifier can now be a curve over time
    Particles: Support for sending custom data to Particle System Vertex Shaders
    Physics: Added more performance metrics to the physics profiler view
    Physics: All effector inspector editors now use animated roll-outs to group properties.
    Physics: EdgeCollider2D and BoxCollider2D and can change the radius of their edges.
    Physics: Physics2D settings now have option to show Collider2D AABB in Gizmo roll-out.
    Physics: Rigidbody2D and Collider2D Inpsector editors now have an 'Info' rolll-out showing useful information.

    Physics: Update from PhysX 3.3.1 to PhysX 3.3.3
    Player: Allow asset bundles to work with engine code stripping. A custom player build can understand which asset bundles will be loaded by the player at run time and determine which parts of the engine code those asset bundles need to preserve. See BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer method change.
    Plugins: You can exclude specific platforms when "Any Platform" is selected, this allows you to set compatibilities as "Plugin is compatible on any platform except this specific platform". Added additional API to PluginImporter.
    SamsungTV: Support for deploying to multiple TVs at once by separating TV IPs with a forward slash.
    Scripting: Editor on OSX will no longer start BugReporter with mono NULL exception if -batchmode
    Scripting: Improve performance System.IO.StringReader.ReadLine
    Scripting: Upgrade C# compiler to Mono 4.4. The new compiler still targets C# 4 and .Net 3.5, but provides better performance and many bug fixes.
    Serialization: Serialization depth limit warning now prints the serialization hierarchy that triggered the warning
    Shaders: Improved memory usage for large shaders compiled for multiple APIs. Only the active API's data will be decompressed in the player.
    Shaders: Improved usability of "Show compiled code" for shaders. Now compiled shader variants are grouped together in a more useful way.
    Shaders: Increased amount of allowed shader keywords to 256 (up from 128). Optimized related parts of the code, so it's often actually faster now.
    Shaders: Material UI displays render queue setting. Previously this was a script-only setting on the material.
    Shaders: Renamed variables and cleaned code in UnityStandardBRDF.cginc
    Shaders: Shaders are now exported to player completely in binary - no shader text string and parsing in the runtime.
    Version Control: Major improvements in memory and cpu usage
    Visual Studio: Add cancel button to "Opening Visual Studio" progress dialog
    VisualStudio: Stop using COM to launch VisualStudio for a better immediate feedback experience

    WebGL: WebGL 2.0 is now enabled by default for new projects
    Windows Standalone: Add option "Copy PDB files" in build settings window which controls copying of pdb files when building to Windows Standalone
    Windows Standalone: Application can now correctly run in low integrity mode. (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb625960.aspx)
    Windows Store: Added "Copy References" option in build settings window, this will allow for generated solution to reference Unity files from Unity installation folder instead of copying them to exported folder, this can save up to 10 GB of disk space, the downside is, you can't copy exported folder to other PC, because there will be a dependency towards Unity's installation folder.
    Windows Store: Expand UnityEngine.WSA.Cursor.SetCustomCursor, if you pass 0 to this function, it will restore the cursor to arror icon
    Windows Store: New implementation for TouchScreenKeyboard on UWP, now supports both XAML and D3D apps as well as IME input. Older implementation can be turned on by passing command line argument -forceTextBoxBasedKeyboard.
    Windows Store: New option for input handling in XAML-based applications: receive poinater input from SwapChainPanel (alternative to independent input source)
    Windows Store: Windows Store platform will not show in build settings window if Editor is ran not on Windows

    Graphics: Added QualitySettings.shadows and QualitySettings.softParticles to the scripting API (805056)
    Graphics: Enable 'BuiltinRenderTextureType.ResolvedDepth' enum so command buffers can use it.
    Graphics: GPU Instancing: Added Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced and CommandBuffer.DrawMeshInstanced API, allowing instanced draws without the overhead of creating thousands of renderers.
    Graphics: Native code plugins can access underlying graphics API Mesh & ComputeBuffer data. New script APIs for that: Mesh.GetNativeIndexBufferPtr, Mesh.GetNativeVertexBufferPtr, ComputeBuffer.GetNativeBufferPtr.
    Graphics: Now BillboardAsset can be constructed from script. Added detailed how-to documents.
    Graphics: SystemInfo.supportsRenderTextures and SystemInfo.supportsStencil always return true now (all platforms have them).
    JSONUtility: EditorJsonUtility methods now accept any object type, not only UnityEngine.Object subclasses
    Particles: Added IsEmitting property.
    Particles: Fully exposed main particle properties to script
    Particles: Particles Stop function now takes an enum to stop emitting or stop emitting and clear.
    Physics: PlatformEffector2D now has a 'rotationalOffset' property to adjust the local 'up' (surface) vector.
    Physics: Rigidbody2D component now has a 'bodyType' property that allows selection of Dynamic, Kinematic or Static bodies.
    Physics: The following properties have been renamed:
        Physics.solverIterationCount to Physics.defaultSolverIterations
        Physics.solverVelocityIterationCount to Physics.defaultSolverVelocityIterations
        Rigidbody.solverIterationCount to Rigidbody.solverIterations
        Rigidbody.solverVelocityIterationCount to Rigidbody.solverVelocityIterations

    Scripting: Add disposable scope helper for Begin/EndChangeCheck
    Scripting: Add missing generic overloads for Object.Instantiate
    Scripting: Introduced global define UNITY_5_5_OR_NEWER, which can be used for conditionally compile code that is compatible only with Unity 5.5 or newer
    Shadows: Exposed LightShadowResolution enum to scripts. (575369)
    Substance: A FreezeAndReleaseSourceData() method was added to the ProceduralMaterial class. This renders the ProceduralMaterial immutable and releases some of the underlying data to decrease the memory footprint. To release even more of the underlying data, it is necessary to call Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets() afterwards. Once frozen, the ProceduralMaterial cannot be cloned, its ProceduralTextures cannot be rebuilt, nor its inputs be set.
    Terrain: Added Terrain.SetSplatMaterialPropertyBlock and Terrain.GetSplatMaterialPropertyBlock API that allows per-terrain shader properties to be used for rendering the terrain.
    Terrain: Added Terrain.treeLODBiasMultiplier for adjusting LOD bias for SpeedTree trees.
    Tizen: Add UnityEngine.Tizen.Window.evasGL to retrieve a pointer to the native Evas_GL object used by Unity to render.
    UI: Added rootCanvas property to Canvas. (782957)
