Improvements

    Animation: Implemented Reset for BlendTrees.
    Editor: Unity now treats quotes in the .exe path as the Windows command line does.
    Graphics: Improved in-editor graphics emulation:
        Metal setting added, used by default on iOS/tvOS (instead of previous GLES2.0 setting).
        OpenGL ES 3.0 setting added, used by default on Android (instead of previous GLES2.0 setting).
        WebGL 1 and WebGL 2 settings added; WebGL1 used by default on WebGL (instead of previous GLES2.0 setting).
        Shader Model 4 setting added, available on Standalone/WindowsStore.
    Particles: Improved the Particle System curve editor: it now supports wrap modes and improved selection and editing of keys.
    Terrain: Terrain LOD pre-computation is optimized and now runs faster (specifically, TerrainData.SetHeights and setting the size property are faster now).
    Unity Ads: Updated Unity Ads to v2.0.5. Fixed crashes related to calling user-defined callbacks from outside the main Unity thread.

API Changes

    Terrain: Added TerrainChangedFlags for use with the OnTerrainChanged message.
    Terrain: Added TerrainData.bounds for retrieving the local bounding box of terrain heightmap data.

    Animation: Added warning icon in animator controller to inform user that a base layer with humanoid motion should preferably not have an avatar mask. (823794)
    Animation: Fixed an issue where Animator.SetTrigger was not forwarded to all AnimatorControllers in a playable graph. (823880)
    Animation: Fixed an issue where deleting an Override controller that was previously set as the runtime controller was resetting the animator stateMachine.
    Animation: Fixed case of an invalid Playable leak message being displayed. (826047)
    Animation: Fixed case of leaking animation clips in Animation Component. (826304)
    Animation: Fixed case of nested property game object name not showing in the animation window when selecting from the project folder. (823679)
