    Graphics: Opening a pre-Unity 5.5 project with Unity 5.5 will set it to forward rendering for all tiers (see Graphics settings/Tier settings), even if the previous project was set to deferred rendering. (826486)
    Graphics: Splash Screen: Only drawn for a single frame on STV.
    IMGUI: Error when opening Shader Forge. (834371)

Improvements

    Graphics: GPU Instancing: Added support for Android with OpenGL ES 3.0 or newer. Note however that GPU instancing support is disabled for Android devices that have the Adreno GPU with only OpenGL ES 3.0, because of driver issues.
    Graphics: GPU Instancing: Added support for Metal.
    Graphics: Metal: Switched the shader backend to HLSLcc.
    Graphics: Multi-scene occlusion culling now works correctly. Culling data has been extracted to a separate asset, and can be baked / reloaded with multi-scene setups. Note that the data is stored relative to the active scene, and is loaded correctly when loading any scene or group of scenes that reference it.
    HoloLens: The tracking loss screen now renders at ~60 FPS (previously ~40 FPS).
    Occlusion Culling: Unity now supports multi-scene occlusion culling. Scenes built concurrently will be computed as expected.
    WebGL: Reduced the size of release builds by stripping away duplicate functions.

    Substance: Fixed crash when selecting a ProceduralMaterial after switching build platform. (820301)
    Substance: Fixed occasional ProceduralMaterial asset import crash. (822217)
