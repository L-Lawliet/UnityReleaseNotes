Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

    Core: Using Object.Instantiate(Object, Transform) will now use the Object position as the local position by default. This is a change from the 5.4 behaviour, which used the Object position as world.

Changes

Improvements

    Android: Added "Mute Other Audio Sources" option to Android player settings in the editor (shared with iOS).
    Android: Enabled TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 for JellyBean and KitKat devices.
    Android: Enhanced big.LITTLE core detection. This fixes core detection on Parker.
    GI: Improved the additive loading error thrown when scenes have different lightmapping modes (made it more user friendly).

API Changes

    Texture Importer: Added GetAutomaticFormat API method to Texture Importer.
